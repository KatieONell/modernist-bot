at first i thought a pest 
must have alighted on my wrist. 
it was a moth almost an owl, 
its wings were furred so well, 
with backgammon-board wedges interlacing 
on the wing— 
like cloth of gold in a pattern 
of scales with a hair-seal persian 
sheen. once, self-determination 
made an axe of a stone 
and hacked things out with hairy paws. the consequence—our mis-set 
alphabet. 
arise, for it is day. 
even gifted scholars lose their way 
through faulty etymology. 
no wonder we hate poetry, 
and stars and harps and the new moon. if tributes cannot 
be implicit, 
give me diatribes and the fragrance of iodine, 
the cork oak acorn grown in spain; 
the pale-ale-eyed impersonal look 
which the sales-placard gives the bock beer buck. 
what is more precise than precision? illusion. 
knights we’ve known, 
like those familiar 
now unfamiliar knights who sought the grail, were 
ducs in old roman fashion 
without the addition 
of wreaths and silver rods, and armor gilded 
or inlaid. 
they did not let self bar 
their usefulness to others who were 
different. though mars is excessive 
is being preventive, 
heroes need not write an ordinall of attributes to enumerate 
what they hate. 
i should, i confess, 
like to have a talk with one of them about excess, 
and armor’s undermining modesty 
instead of innocent depravity. 
a mirror-of-steel uninsistence should countenance 
continence, 
objectified and not by chance, 
there in its frame of circumstance 
of innocence and altitude 
in an unhackneyed solitude. 
there is the tarnish; and there, the imperishable wish.
