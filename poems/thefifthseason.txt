fifteen minutes in any direction is all 
cornfields antlers and leaning 
barns' definition of extinction, 
porch collections of tins and paint 
brushes writing down the most recent 
myth of where our ghosts go 
and whether they'll hold 
here like the oldest teacher in town 
uncertain if he emptied the vodka 
before his cup filled with rain. 
the town good fortune drove 
through and kept on going, left 
generations to sweep dust, 
letters fallen from the theatre 
marquee and the smell of diesel 
persistent as the mottled 
bark of the sycamores that cracked 
before the brick face of the town 
turned red and laid the rest 
in the old river dreaming. 
and you who left the town, 
city after city while you sleep 
curled like a question are 
taken back on these walks 
eyelids ghosted along the bare 
lit streets lost looking for the reason 
the shape of your leaving became 
the shape of your seeing: 
nameless as the fifth season 
of the old river dreaming.
