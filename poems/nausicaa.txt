she remembers only her dreaming. refashions herself 
in the morning as if sleep has removed a piece of her, 
changed and replaced it before she woke. i, too, am at 
her knees, have been for some time now, but not as 
part of the dream. she cannot see me lying waterlogged 
on the sand in front of her; steps on my hand and 
walks by. it doesn't matter what i am. there is a certain 
pleasure in that.

killarnoe is a place i invented right 
now. i just built it from my head. i started 
with a letter k and set down the letters 
that spilled out. what does that say when k-i-l-l 
first sprouts? something repressed, or 
an instinct, that when allowed a moment's 
free reign, opens to its own mind 
and speaks bluntly? but see how i persisted 
past the first impulse to slash at the page's 
clean white throat, and instead adorned it 
with a pretty vowel, gently drawing out the ells 
to sulk the k down into a rumbled, 
grudging argument against the mind's knee- 
jerk proposal, the oh opening to compromise, 
and a silent e watching without judgement.
