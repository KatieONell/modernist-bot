i can see from where i sit 
a freight train going by, rolling forward 
in the dark. i can't tell if it's one long train 
or a dozen—i close my eyes, listen. 
a freight train going by, rolling forward 
as our conversation backs up, bridges one gap 
or a dozen. i close my eyes, listen. 
there are gates within us, you say, 
as our conversation backs up, bridges a gap. 
you reach across the table, take my hand. 
there are gates within us, you say 
again. you're right, there's always a distance.
