the field that stretched beyond 
goalposts. the field that redrew 
lines in us. 
like the field in a glove save. 
a high-five. the field in a radio hit, 
its raised seating. 
or, the field in waiting. the field in hunger. 
the field in a fifth beer, a wrong turn, 
the field in the little scar 
on your neighbour's forehead. 
the field in every abandoned thing 
we found in that field. in every bent putter. 
torn jacket. set of keys. 
the field in forgetting. in debt.
