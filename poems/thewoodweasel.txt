emerges daintily, the skunk— 
don’t laugh—in sylvan black and white chipmunk 
regalia. the inky thing 
adaptively whited with glistening 
goat-fur, is wood-warden. in his 
ermined well-cuttlefish-inked wool, he is 
determination’s totem. outlawed? 
his sweet face and powerful feet go about 
in chieftain’s coat of chilcat cloth. 
he is his own protection from the moth, 
noble little warrior. that 
otter-skin on it, the living pole-cat, 
smothers anything that stings. well,— 
this same weasel’s playful and his weasel 
associates are too. only 
wood-weasels shall associate with me.
