everyone's uncle thinks that they are the world'sâ€¨most handsomeândn, and no one says otherwise. 
rez dogs roam about without having to performâ€¨emotional labour for humans. they eat where they 
are welcomed, which is everywhere. most who liveâ€¨here do not know that they are in the ruins of a sick 
experiment that failed. teens blaze to feel theâ€¨euphoria of being outside of memory. 
we all bathe in the sociality of the hangover. it is notâ€¨that no one has time for themselves, it is that they are 
always playing cards or talking about connor mcdavidâ€¨or carpooling to bingo or babysitting their brothers' kids. 
we all owe something to someone, so we congregateâ€¨under the pretense of debt, and this is always-already. 
we all joke about falling in love with our cousins,â€¨but we are all perpetually falling in love with our cousins 
in a platonic way, because we grew up together andâ€¨no one was alienated by the tyranny of the couple form. 
vehicles pass through in droves, but no one looks,â€¨so we drown together in the freedom of utter anonymity.
