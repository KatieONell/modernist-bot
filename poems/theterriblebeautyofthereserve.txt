everyone's uncle thinks that they are the world's most handsomendn, and no one says otherwise. 
rez dogs roam about without having to perform emotional labour for humans. they eat where they 
are welcomed, which is everywhere. most who live here do not know that they are in the ruins of a sick 
experiment that failed. teens blaze to feel the euphoria of being outside of memory. 
we all bathe in the sociality of the hangover. it is not that no one has time for themselves, it is that they are 
always playing cards or talking about connor mcdavid or carpooling to bingo or babysitting their brothers' kids. 
we all owe something to someone, so we congregate under the pretense of debt, and this is always-already. 
we all joke about falling in love with our cousins, but we are all perpetually falling in love with our cousins 
in a platonic way, because we grew up together and no one was alienated by the tyranny of the couple form. 
vehicles pass through in droves, but no one looks, so we drown together in the freedom of utter anonymity.
