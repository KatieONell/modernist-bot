it's the middle of the night. 
i've set the house on fire 
with those matches i love, 
the ones in the kitchen 
with the red bird on the box. 
you can strike them anywhere. 
allumettes qui s'allument partout. 
take care: may ignite if box is 
dropped, shaken, or crushed. 
this same bird flies through 
a tattoo on your arm. 
the house is burning down 
and i am thinking of boats. 
you hate the matches, the smell 
of bent, black spoons. 
i light one and it falls to the floor. 
another and another. take care. 
i don't know what to save 
from this place, sailing from wall 
to wall, room to room, smoking. 
you are not here. you are rain 
battering against some window. 
i don't know what to save. 
the red bird eats everything in sight.
