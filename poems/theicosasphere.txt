"in buckinghamshire hedgerows 
the birds nesting in the merged green density, 
weave little bits of string and moths and feathers and thistledown, 
in parabolic concentric curves" 
and, working for concavity, leave spherical feats of rare efficiency; 
whereas through lack of integration, 
avid for someone’s fortune, 
three were slain and ten committed perjury, 
six died, two killed themselves, and two paid fines for risks they’d run. 
but then there is the icosasphere 
in which at last we have steel-cutting at its summit of economy, 
since twenty triangles conjoined, can wrap one 
ball or double-rounded shell 
with almost no waste, so geometrically 
neat, it’s an icosahedron. would the engineers making one, 
or mr. j. o. jackson tell us 
how the egyptians could have set up seventy-eight-foot solid granite vertically? 
we should like to know how that was done.
