into the chicken coop. 
and where are the chickens? 
i wished the lambs a pasture the size of the donkeys'. 
and i wished for the donkeys— 
i wished something very large for the donkeys. 
i am a donkey. 
there was ginger ale, coke zero, 
and mexican beer 
on the small cart of the small donkey. 
the large and 
heavy head of a 
donkey 
covered in several burlap sacks.
