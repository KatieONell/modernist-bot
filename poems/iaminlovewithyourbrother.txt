richie made me promise not to relate any stories of 
embarrassment or crime, but, richie, on 
this, the evening of your nuptials, i must tell them about 
our long day in truro. i just must. the fallacy then 
was a dark twin of tonight's fallacy, we 
and the dogs—who are thought to be clairvoyant 
on these matters—anticipated storms 
that never came, and here we are now, beneath 
a tarpaulin, on an evening they reported 
would be clear and ideal for regattas. 
as truro woke, as truro's rodents spat their 
morning songs, richie came across my notebook, open 
to its core, and spotted my little admission: 
i am in love with your brother. 
the first line, i insisted, of a song i'd been arranging 
to be played on the wurlitzer, though now i 
come clean, richie, while your soul is at its smoothest 
and most forgiving, i did love him, the crimson acne 
flecked across his neck, he was like a man 
a guillotine had made an attempt at. 
we rolled that whole notebook into joints, didn't we, 
richie, then drove into the boonies to shove ammo 
into rifles folk left above their porch doors. 
that summer, your brother's motorboat 
slipped into the irish sea, his mannequin body 
demolished, and i'll bet he is here now, and is 
glad, i am sure of this. caroline, richie 
is one hell of a guy. you would do best to keep 
his body firmly in yours, how seas contain boats, 
for he is only stories to me now.
