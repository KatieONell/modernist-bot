winked too much and were afraid of snakes. the zebras, supreme in 
their abnormality; the elephants with their fog-colored skin 
and strictly practical appendages 
were there, the small cats; and the parakeet— 
trivial and humdrum on examination, destroying 
bark and portions of the food it could not eat. 
i recall their magnificence, now not more magnificent 
than it is dim. it is difficult to recall the ornament, 
speech, and precise manner of what one might 
call the minor acquaintances twenty 
years back; but i shall not forget him—that gilgamesh among 
the hairy carnivora—that cat with the 
wedge-shaped, slate-gray marks on its forelegs and the resolute tail, 
astringently remarking: "they have imposed on us with their pale 
half fledged protestations, trembling about 
in inarticulate frenzy, saying 
it is not for us to understand art; finding it 
all so difficult, examining the thing 
as if it were inconceivably arcanic, as symmet- 
rically frigid as if it had been carved out of chrysoprase 
or marble—strict with tension, malignant 
in its power over us and deeper 
than the sea when it proffers flattery in exchange for hemp, 
rye, flax, horses, platinum, timber, and fur.
