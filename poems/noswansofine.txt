"no water so still as the 
dead fountains of versailles." no swan, 
with swart blind look askance 
and gondoliering legs, so fine 
as the chintz china one with fawn- 
brown eyes and toothed gold 
collar on to show whose bird it was. 
lodged in the louis fifteenth 
candelabrum-tree of cockscomb- 
tinted buttons, dahlias, 
sea-urchins, and everlastings, 
it perches on the branching foam 
of polished sculptured 
flowersâ€”at ease and tall. the king is dead.
