fists in our sleeves, we reach our limit. no way 
past lake ontario, nothing else to do 
until you say the thing you need to say. 
sweeten it if you like. stir in a name. 
it's only talk and we've talked our heads to 
foam before, testing the limit in a way. 
like the last time our four feet inched partway 
over the city's ledge. lightheaded you 
started to say something you needed to say 
then started again, we could– we can fly one way. 
right over the lake. how you said it, as if we were two 
wild geese, no credit limit in the way. ain't no way, 
i said. way. no way. way. tonight at the lake 
your courage fails again. knuckles in your pits, you 
flap your arms and squawk. say what you're dying to say. 
of course, don't. we're getting carried away. 
we'll stay this side of lake ontario, clenched. nous 
sommes à la limite de l'amitié – find a way 
to translate. if you won't say, i won't say.
