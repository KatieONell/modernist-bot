one likes to see a laggard rook’s high 
speed at sunset to outfly the dark, 
or a mount well schooled for a medal— 
front legs tucked under for the barrier, 
or team of leapers turned aerial. 
i recall a documentary 
of cossacks: a visual fugue, a mist 
of swords that seemed to sever 
heads from bodies—feet stepping as through 
harp-strings in a scherzo. however, 
the quadrille of old russia for me: 
with aimlessly drooping handkerchief 
snapped like the crack of a whip; 
a deliriously spun-out-level 
frock-coat skirt, unswirled and a-droop 
in remote promenade. let me see … 
old russia, did i say? cold russia 
this time: the prize bunnyhug 
and platform-piece of experts in the 
trip-and-slug of wrestlers in a rug. 
"sacked" and ready for bed apparently— 
with a jab, a kick, pinned to the wall, 
they work toward the edge and stick; 
stagger off, and one is victim of a 
flipflop—leg having circled leg as thick. 
some art, because of high quality, 
is unlikely to command high sales; 
yes, no doubt; but here, oh no; 
not with the frozen north’s nan-ai-ans 
of the sack in their tight touch-and-go. 
these battlers, dressed identically— 
just one person—may, by seeming twins, 
point a moral, should i confess; 
we must cement the parts of any 
objective symbolic of sagesse.
