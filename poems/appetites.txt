you wake hearing the girl next door come in at two a.m. 
in the event that it's a ghost, it's telling you 
not to waste time in bed 
worrying. 
you should be sleeping, or doing 
anything else. 
you haven't yet seen the faun, the red fox, 
or the rabbit. 
the statue of a woman in the lily-padded lake is waist-deep, 
a mimicry of diana's animal life, suspicious of sleep. 
with her in mind, you're troubled even thinking of things 
that don't frighten you. 
but this, too, is a waste of time and talent. 
there is good slumber 
to be sought in the rush of ruminations outside yourself: 
in listlessness of reeds on the dead embankment, 
in languor of bee by a late marigold 
or duck feathers gathering in a corner of falling 
water. 
you realize you haven't organized your life. 
you've forgotten yourself entirely. 
you wake up and try to pick up the thread.
