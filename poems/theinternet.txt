i first heard about it in a burger king. 
its aims seemed as elusive as the stock ticker 
or why some people stayed in marriages. 
the future was flying cars, phone screens, and minidisc. 
i bused tables with a cloth that mucked the laminate sheen 
and, just that spring, an annular eclipse ringed the sky 
like we were suddenly looking down a cabled conduit. 
then, as if an indigenous strain moving beyond a range map, 
people started getting it, birdsong calling up from basements, 
the pink noise, hiss, and crackle of a connection made. 
and somebody already had some pictures: the body, 
pixelated, bare, with the feeling you were overseeing it, 
moving along the conveyer belt of banner ads. 
days went by like they were being dragged into a bin. 
somewhere, fibers tethered us to a warehouse or a factory, 
but for then the feed seemed as ephemeral as a thought. 
the search bar like a mail slot you could lift 
just enough to see inside somebody else's space. 
it wasn't a place, but you could go there. 
at night, blinds down, but windows open, flags of light 
were quietly raised from main floors up into our rooms.
