in this camera shot, 
from that fine print in which you hide 
(eight-pony portrait from the side), 
you seem to recognize 
a recognizing eye, 
limber bug. 
only partly said, perhaps, it has been implied 
that you seem to be the one to ride. 
i don’t know how you got your name 
and don’t like to inquire. 
nothing more punitive than the pest 
who says, "i’m trespassing," and 
does it just the same. 
i’ve guessed, i think. 
i like a face that seems a nest, 
a "mere container for the eye"— 
triangle-cornered—and 
pitchfork-pronged ears stiffly parallel: 
bug brother to an arthur 
mitchell dragonfly, 
speeding to left, 
speeding to right; reversible, 
like "turns in an ancient chinese 
melody, a thirteen 
twisted silk-string three-finger solo." 
there they are, yellow riverscroll 
accuracies 
of your version 
of something similar—polo. 
restating it: 
pelo, i turn, 
on polos, a pivot. 
if a little elaborate, 
redon (odilon) brought it to mind, 
his thought of the eye, 
of revolving—combined somehow with pastime— 
pastime that is work, 
muscular docility, 
also mentality, 
as in the acrobat li siau than, 
gibbonlike but limberer, 
defying gravity, 
nether side arched up, 
cup on head not upset— 
china’s very most ingenious man.
