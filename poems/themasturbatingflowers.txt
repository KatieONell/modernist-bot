ignore meâ€”i am frail today. 
if i tell you to stop 
walking, keep walking. if i ask 
for a piece of your nectarine, 
or press your palm 
against my chest, where the ribs sink 
most, where your come, months 
ago, would collect and grow cold, 
keep walking. all around us, 
library books used to wilt and expire, 
and if we were outside, 
the masturbating flowers 
would bite their filthy lips. 
sitting in the narrow shadow 
of an infantile willow, 
with a paperback, and a highlighter 
to mark the words 
we wanted in our lives forever. 
the penultimate embrace, abbreviated 
by such factors as the arrival 
of the streetcar and the heterosexual gaze. 
the ultimate, unabbreviated: a decadence 
of unclean teeth. i've since begun flossing. 
there's blood sometimes so oral 
has been taken off the table. 
a raw gum is a head wound, like any 
other, a door a blight loves the sight of. 
it gets men all choleric, though. 
in the yellow light, with their yellow feet, 
they push my body away.
