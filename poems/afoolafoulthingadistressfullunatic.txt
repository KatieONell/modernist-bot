with webs of cool 
chain mail and his stout heart, is not the gander 
mocked, and ignorantly designated yet, 
to play the fool? 
"egyptian vultures clean as cherubim, 
all ivory and jet," are they most foul? 
and nature’s child, 
that most precocious water bird, the loon — why 
is he foremost in the madman’s alphabet; 
why is he styled 
in folly’s catalogue, distressful lunatic?
