moths feather your far gazebo 
like young sailors on first leave. 
you know something, and keep reminding me 
of my own needs. you see an audience 
of blooming heads and sugared bank notes, 
and act accordingly. the swallows see it at five o'clock, 
a wolfman's tragedy. 
they hang themselves upside down, 
handsome sienna prizes in the semaphore of bats. 
swayed by a summer night, i swing out 
to your silk pocket square standing at attention, 
a bird about-face. you're the dark dew on the green grass of home.
