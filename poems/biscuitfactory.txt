near where my father worked in victoria? 
thick black fuel tanks sprang from the ground 
where condos now simper. my father climbed 
to the top of the silos on a winding steel ladder 
to document gauges. we drove up in the chevy, 
to fetch him for dinner, my mother in a red-belted 
peter pan dress and stockings. he gave us treats— 
nickels, raisins, candies—; he emptied his pockets, 
and then my brother and i climbed up the side of the vats 
as high as we could before our parents finished their kiss, 
and noticed us. you know, the condos there now, 
where the oil tanks were, 
and the biscuit factory turned into self-storage, 
are nothing to what happened to the girls 
i thought were my friends, and me. 
we lined up at dior in paris with the models, 
and went in. our hair shone like glass, and we glittered, too, 
all three of us, with our fine, invisible, unusable talents.
