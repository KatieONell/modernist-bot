over dinner, my landlady laughs 
about her day teaching rich korean kids 
the difference between a nightstand 
and a one-night stand. her son goes wild 
for the bicycle pump. from his highchair, 
he wails, erupting borscht. refuses to sit 
without its hard plastic denting his chin. 
i don't get relationships. once i got lace 
panties in the mail from a friend who lives 
in winnipeg. he wrote, i'm coming to visit 
you at christmas! so i spent december 
pretending to be busy, ice-skating until 
my feet purpled, wondering how love 
could transpire so oppositely between two 
people. my mother once loved a grey van so 
completely she sat in it for twenty minutes 
every winter morning while it defrosted. 
they listened to the radio together, to her 
favourite tapes. the van went everywhere 
with her, unlike my father who plays poker. 
it lived for thirteen years in our driveway, 
a great burgundy-upholstered beacon 
of dependability, until its engine went. 
i want to climb into you and strap myself in, 
but that's not really love. instead, we idle 
in separate uncertainties, exhausting 
reassurances. you thank my landlady 
for dinner and roll away into a night 
that imperfectly intersects my own, and i try 
to stop imagining the ways we could fail 
each other, and the people in rooms 
everywhere who are continually failing 
each other, and hope toward someday 
having one nightstand with you, maybe two.
