it's this not knowing 
when the guest will leave 
and you are the guest. 
not quite knowing where 
to sit, the couch?, or how 
often to clean or cook before 
it's more a chore 
for your host 
who seems to be a horse 
with eyes that narrow 
in the wide open of your stay. 
i've not once mentioned 
a higher power and now 
here is this horse. her coat 
is the colour of how much 
night is required to see 
the barely glowing light switch 
i speak to from bed. 
where can we possibly 
go from here? 
and look if i knew 
where i left my 
light jacket 
i'd put it on already. 
i am aâman going crazy 
because he has seen 
a colour no one else has 
but there is no way 
to prove it. it exists 
for no one but him. 
it is the colour of my jacket, 
i'm certain. i'm going to need it. 
it's almost spring.
