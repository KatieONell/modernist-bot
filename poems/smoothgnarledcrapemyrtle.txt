a brass-green bird with grass- 
green throat smooth as a nut, springs from 
twig to twig askew, copying the 
chinese flower piece—businesslike atom 
in the stiff-leafed tree’s blue- 
pink, dregs-of-wine, pyramids 
of mathematic 
circularity—one of a 
pair. a redbird with a hatchet 
crest lights straight, on a twig 
between the two, bending the 
peculiar 
bouquet down; and there are 
several black antique 
bootjack fireflies touched with weak bright 
hunting-pink. "the legendary white- 
eared black bulbul that sings 
only in pure sanskrit" should 
be here—"tame clever 
true nightingale." the cardinal- 
bird that is usually a 
pair looks somewhat odd, like 
"the ambassadorial 
inverness 
worn by one who dresses 
in new york but dreams of 
london." it was artifice saw 
on a patch-box pigeon-egg, room for 
fervent script, and wrote as with a bird’s claw 
under the pair on the 
hyacinth-blue lid—"joined in 
friendship, crowned by love." 
an aspect may deceive; as the 
elephant’s columbine-tubed trunk 
held waveringly out— 
an at will heavy thing—is 
delicate. 
art is unfortunate. 
one may be a blameless 
bachelor and it is but a 
step to congreve. a rosalindless 
redbird comes where people are, knowing they 
have not made a point of 
being where he is—this bird 
which says not sings, "without 
loneliness i should be more 
lonely, so i keep it"—half in 
japanese. and what of 
our clasped hands that swear "by peace 
plenty; as 
by wisdom peace." alas!
