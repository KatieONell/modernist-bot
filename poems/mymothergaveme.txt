a photo album. there were a handful 
of pictures and i am the same age 
in every one. there is one photo of me 
and my father on the day he taught me 
how to ride my bike. we are laughing 
and in the lower left corner is a small 
boy sitting on a park bench watching us. 
he's my brother. i always thought 
he was the favourite one, the one 
they really wanted. i did not think 
of what i might have looked like to him. 
he is looking on in this photo, sitting 
on a park bench. he does not have a bike 
of his own. it is the same with his clothes. 
the clothes he wore had been mine, 
green overalls, blue shirt, all the winter jackets 
and snowsuits. never knowing the feel of new 
things. even the haircut he has is mine. 
in a few years, he too will have this bike. 
but no one will have taken the time to teach 
him how to ride it without the training wheels 
because they had come off years before. he 
will ride this bike as i left it, like everything else 
i had, and it will still be pink and the flowers printed on it 
will still be there. there will be no picture of that day. 
there is only a picture of this day. 
this day of him sitting on the park bench alone, 
hands in his lap, looking on and waiting for his turn.
