i didn't look at the fire. 
i looked into it. 
i saw a wall of books 
crash down and bury me 
centuries deep in red leather. 
i saw a statue in a park 
shake dust from its fist 
and a ship called everything 
sink down on rusted wings. 
ten thousand triangles collapsed 
into a point 
and the point was this. 
i cannot tell you what i saw. 
my catastrophe was sweet 
and nothing like yours 
although we may sip 
from the same 
broken cup all afternoon.
