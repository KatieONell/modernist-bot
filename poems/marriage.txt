this institution, 
perhaps one should say enterprise 
out of respect for which 
one says one need not change oneâ€™s mind 
about a thing one has believed in, 
requiring public promises 
of oneâ€™s intention 
to fulfill a private obligation: 
i wonder what adam and eve 
think of it by this time, 
this firegilt steel 
alive with goldenness; 
how bright it showsâ€” 
"of circular traditions and impostures, 
committing many spoils," 
requiring all oneâ€™s criminal ingenuity 
to avoid! 
psychology which explains everything 
explains nothing 
and we are still in doubt. 
eve: beautiful womanâ€” 
i have seen her 
when she was so handsome 
she gave me a start, 
able to write simultaneously 
in three languagesâ€” 
english, german and french 
and talk in the meantime; 
equally positive in demanding a commotion 
and in stipulating quiet: 
"i should like to be alone"; 
to which the visitor replies, 
"i should like to be alone; 
why not be alone together?" 
below the incandescent stars 
below the incandescent fruit, 
the strange experience of beauty; 
its existence is too much; 
it tears one to pieces 
and each fresh wave of consciousness 
is poison. 
"see her, see her in this common world," 
the central flaw 
in that first crystal-fine experiment, 
this amalgamation which can never be more 
than an interesting impossibility, 
describing it 
as "that strange paradise 
unlike flesh, gold, or stately buildings, 
the choicest piece of my life: 
the heart rising 
in its estate of peace 
as a boat rises 
with the rising of the water"; 
constrained in speaking of the serpentâ€” 
that shed snakeskin in the history of politeness 
not to be returned to againâ€” 
that invaluable accident 
exonerating adam. 
and he has beauty also; 
itâ€™s distressingâ€”the o thou 
to whom, from whom, 
without whom nothingâ€”adam; 
"something feline, 
something colubrine"â€”how true! 
a crouching mythological monster 
in that persian miniature of emerald mines, 
raw silkâ€”ivory white, snow white, 
oyster white and six othersâ€” 
that paddock full of leopards and giraffesâ€” 
long lemon-yellow bodies 
sown with trapezoids of blue. 
alive with words, 
vibrating like a cymbal 
touched before it has been struck, 
he has prophesied correctlyâ€” 
the industrious waterfall, 
"the speedy stream 
which violently bears all before it, 
at one time silent as the air 
and now as powerful as the wind." 
"treading chasms 
on the uncertain footing of a spear," 
forgetting that there is in woman 
a quality of mind 
which as an instinctive manifestation 
is unsafe, 
he goes on speaking 
in a formal, customary strain 
of "past states, the present state, 
seals, promises, 
the evil one suffered, 
the good one enjoys, 
hell, heaven, 
everything convenient 
to promote oneâ€™s joy." 
there is in him a state of mind 
by force of which, 
perceiving what it was not 
intended that he should, 
"he experiences a solemn joy 
in seeing that he has become an idol." 
plagued by the nightingale 
in the new leaves, 
with its silenceâ€” 
not its silence but its silences, 
he says of it: 
"it clothes me with a shirt of fire." 
"he dares not clap his hands 
to make it go on 
lest it should fly off; 
if he does nothing, it will sleep; 
if he cries out, it will not understand." 
unnerved by the nightingale 
and dazzled by the apple, 
impelled by "the illusion of a fire 
effectual to extinguish fire," 
compared with which 
the shining of the earth 
is but deformityâ€”a fire 
"as high as deep as bright as broad 
as long as life itself," 
he stumbles over marriage, 
"a very trivial object indeed" 
to have destroyed the attitude 
in which he stoodâ€” 
the ease of the philosopher 
unfathered by a woman. 
unhelpful hymen! 
"a kind of overgrown cupid" 
reduced to insignificance 
by the mechanical advertising 
parading as involuntary comment, 
by that experiment of adamâ€™s 
with ways out but no way inâ€” 
the ritual of marriage, 
augmenting all its lavishness; 
its fiddle-head ferns, 
lotus flowers, opuntias, white dromedaries, 
its hippopotamusâ€” 
nose and mouth combined 
in one magnificent hopper, 
"the crested screamerâ€” 
that huge bird almost a lizard," 
its snake and the potent apple. 
he tells us 
that "for love 
that will gaze an eagle blind, 
that is like a hercules 
climbing the trees 
in the garden of the hesperides, 
from forty-five to seventy 
is the best age," 
commending it 
as a fine art, as an experiment, 
a duty or as merely recreation. 
one must not call him ruffian 
nor friction a calamityâ€” 
the fight to be affectionate: 
"no truth can be fully known 
until it has been tried 
by the tooth of disputation." 
the blue panther with black eyes, 
the basalt panther with blue eyes, 
entirely gracefulâ€” 
one must give them the pathâ€” 
the black obsidian diana 
who "darkeneth her countenance 
as a bear doth, 
causing her husband to sigh," 
the spiked hand 
that has an affection for one 
and proves it to the bone, 
impatient to assure you 
that impatience is the mark of independence 
not of bondage. 
"married people often look that way"â€” 
"seldom and cold, up and down, 
mixed and malarial 
with a good day and bad." 
"when do we feed?" 
we occidentals are so unemotional, 
we quarrel as we feed; 
oneâ€™s self quite lost, 
the irony preserved 
in "the ahasuerus tãªte ã tãªte banquet" 
with its "good monster, lead the way," 
with little laughter 
and munificence of humor 
in that quixotic atmosphere of frankness 
in which "four oâ€™clock does not exist 
but at five oâ€™clock 
the ladies in their imperious humility 
are ready to receive you"; 
in which experience attests 
that men have power 
and sometimes one is made to feel it. 
he says, "what monarch would not blush 
to have a wife 
with hair like a shaving-brush? 
the fact of woman 
is not â€˜the sound of the flute 
but very poison." 
she says, "â€˜men are monopolists 
of stars, garters, buttons 
and other shining baublesâ€™â€” 
unfit to be the guardians 
of another personâ€™s happiness." 
he says, "these mummies 
must be handled carefullyâ€” 
â€˜the crumbs from a lionâ€™s meal, 
a couple of shins and the bit of an earâ€™; 
turn to the letter m 
and you will find 
that â€˜a wife is a coffin,â€™ 
that severe object 
with the pleasing geometry 
stipulating space and not people, 
refusing to be buried 
and uniquely disappointing, 
revengefully wrought in the attitude 
of an adoring child 
to a distinguished parent." 
she says, "this butterfly, 
this waterfly, this nomad 
that has â€˜proposed 
to settle on my hand for life.â€™â€” 
what can one do with it? 
there must have been more time 
in shakespeareâ€™s day 
to sit and watch a play. 
you know so many artists who are fools." 
he says, "you know so many fools 
who are not artists." 
the fact forgot 
that "some have merely rights 
while some have obligations," 
he loves himself so much, 
he can permit himself 
no rival in that love. 
she loves herself so much, 
she cannot see herself enoughâ€” 
a statuette of ivory on ivory, 
the logical last touch 
to an expansive splendor 
earned as wages for work done: 
one is not rich but poor 
when one can always seem so right. 
what can one do for themâ€” 
these savages 
condemned to disaffect 
all those who are not visionaries 
alert to undertake the silly task 
of making people noble? 
this model of petrine fidelity 
who "leaves her peaceful husband 
only because she has seen enough of him"â€“ 
that orator reminding you, 
"i am yours to command." 
"everything to do with love is mystery; 
it is more than a dayâ€™s work 
to investigate this science." 
one sees that it is rareâ€” 
that striking grasp of opposites 
opposed each to the other, not to unity, 
which in cycloid inclusiveness 
has dwarfed the demonstration 
of columbus with the eggâ€” 
a triumph of simplicityâ€” 
that charitive euroclydon 
of frightening disinterestedness 
which the world hates, 
admitting: 
"i am such a cow, 
if i had a sorrow, 
i should feel it a long time; 
i am not one of those 
who have a great sorrow 
in the morning 
and a great joy at noon"; 
which says: "i have encountered it 
among those unpretentious 
protegã©s of wisdom, 
where seeming to parade 
as the debater and the roman, 
the statesmanship 
of an archaic daniel webster 
persists to their simplicity of temper 
as the essence of the matter: 
â€˜liberty and union 
now and foreverâ€™; 
the book on the writing-table; 
the hand in the breast-pocket.
