the mayor's accountant was as humourless 
as a glass of snow. 
a glass of snow was on the lawn. 
the tongues of the deer 
are the tongues of the gods 
according to local legend. 
the deer, growing brave, 
dipped their little tongues into the glass 
while the mayor's accountant 
holidayed with his shame. 
he put a gun to his mouth 
as the sun shone in boca raton. 
snowfall continued at home. 
the mayor's spiel was the same.
