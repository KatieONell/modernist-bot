there are four vibrators, the world’s exactest clocks; 
and these quartz time-pieces that tell 
time intervals to other clocks, 
these worksless clocks work well; 
and all four, independently the 
same, are there in the cool bell 
laboratory time 
vault. checked by a comparator with arlington, 
they punctualize the "radio, 
cinéma," and "presse,"—a group the 
giraudoux truth-bureau 
of hoped-for accuracy has termed 
"instruments of truth." we know— 
as jean giraudoux says 
certain arabs have not heard—that napoleon 
is dead; that a quartz prism when 
the temperature changes, feels 
the change and that the then 
electrified alternate edges 
oppositely charged, threaten 
careful timing; so that 
this water-clear crystal as the greeks used to say, 
this "clear ice" must be kept at the 
same coolness. repetition, with 
the scientist, should be 
synonymous with accuracy. 
the lemur-student can see 
that an aye-aye is not 
an angwan-tíbo, potto, or loris. the sea- 
side burden should not embarrass 
the bell-boy with the buoy-ball 
endeavoring to pass 
hotel patronesses; nor could a 
practiced ear confuse the glass 
eyes for taxidermists 
with eye-glasses from the optometrist. and as 
meridian-7 1, 2 
1, 2 gives, each fifteenth second 
in the same voice, the new 
data—"the time will be" so and so— 
you realize that "when you 
hear the signal," you’ll be 
hearing jupiter or jour pater, the day god— 
the salvaged son of father time— 
telling the cannibal chronos 
(eater of his proxime 
newborn progeny) that punctuality 
is not a crime.
