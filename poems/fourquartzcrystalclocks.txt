there are four vibrators, the worldâ€™s exactest clocks; 
and these quartz time-pieces that tell 
time intervals to other clocks, 
these worksless clocks work well; 
and all four, independently the 
same, are there in the cool bell 
laboratory time 
vault. checked by a comparator with arlington, 
they punctualize the "radio, 
cinã©ma," and "presse,"â€”a group the 
giraudoux truth-bureau 
of hoped-for accuracy has termed 
"instruments of truth." we knowâ€” 
as jean giraudoux says 
certain arabs have not heardâ€”that napoleon 
is dead; that a quartz prism when 
the temperature changes, feels 
the change and that the then 
electrified alternate edges 
oppositely charged, threaten 
careful timing; so that 
this water-clear crystal as the greeks used to say, 
this "clear ice" must be kept at the 
same coolness. repetition, with 
the scientist, should be 
synonymous with accuracy. 
the lemur-student can see 
that an aye-aye is not 
an angwan-tã­bo, potto, or loris. the sea- 
side burden should not embarrass 
the bell-boy with the buoy-ball 
endeavoring to pass 
hotel patronesses; nor could a 
practiced ear confuse the glass 
eyes for taxidermists 
with eye-glasses from the optometrist. and as 
meridian-7 1, 2 
1, 2 gives, each fifteenth second 
in the same voice, the new 
dataâ€”"the time will be" so and soâ€” 
you realize that "when you 
hear the signal," youâ€™ll be 
hearing jupiter or jour pater, the day godâ€” 
the salvaged son of father timeâ€” 
telling the cannibal chronos 
(eater of his proxime 
newborn progeny) that punctuality 
is not a crime.
