and much fruit, the swan— 
one line of the mathematician’s 
sign greater-than, drawn 
to an apex where the lake is 
met by the weight on it; or an angel 
standing in the sun, how well 
armed, how manly; 
and promenading 
in sloughs of despond, a monster— 
man when human nothing 
more, grown to immaturity, 
punishing debtors, seeking his due—as 
an arrow turned inward has 
no chance of peace.
