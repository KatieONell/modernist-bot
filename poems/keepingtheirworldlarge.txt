all too literally, their flesh 
and their spirit are our shield 
new york times, 7th june, 1944 
i should like to see that country’s tiles, bedrooms, 
stone patios 
and ancient wells: rinaldo 
caramonica’s the cobbler’s, frank sblendorio’s 
and dominick angelastro’s country— 
the grocer’s, the iceman’s, the dancer’s—the 
beautiful miss damiano’s; wisdom’s 
and all angels’ italy, this christmas day 
this christmas year. 
a noiseless piano, an 
innocent war, the heart that can act against itself. here, 
each unlike and all alike, could 
so many—stumbling, falling, multiplied 
till bodies lay as ground to walk on—say 
"if christ and the apostles died in vain, i’ll 
die in vain with them"? 
when the very heart was a prayer 
against this way of victory. stem after stem 
of what we call the tree—set, row 
on row; that forest of white crosses; the 
vision makes us faint. my eyes won’t close to it. while 
the knife was lifted, isaac the offering 
lay mute. 
these, laid like animals for sacrifice, 
like isaac on the mount, were their own substitute. 
and must they all be harmed by those 
whom they have saved. tears that don’t fall are what 
they wanted. belief in belief marching 
marching marching—all alone, all similar, 
spurning pathos, 
clothed in fear—marching to death 
marching to life; it was like the cross, is like the cross. 
keeping their world large, that silent 
marching marching marching and this silence 
for which there is no description, are 
the voices of fighters with no rests between, 
who would not yield; 
whose spirits and whose bodies 
all too literally were our shield, are still our shield. 
they fought the enemy, we fight 
fat living and self-pity. shine, o shine 
unfalsifying sun, on this sick scene.
