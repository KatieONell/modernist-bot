i've taken rest on a boulder in this clearing 
to finish thinking on it while the quiet's 
still hovering around me. i'm like a spring 
someone is flattening until it lies 
uncoiling on the ground, the tension light 
now pressure's been removed. i wanted rest 
but not this closure: things were piling up 
and i was full of them, and being pressed 
to take on more. i couldn't interrupt 
the constant flow of work because i'd slept 
poorly or the load was heavy: weren't 
we all carrying too much? the noise 
is what i miss—the shackle line's chain 
like glass bottles clinking after toil, 
the scald tank's clang amidst the seething boil 
was the sound of railway cars as couplings claimed 
them. always the drone of the main line, 
the slowly turning wheel and its rusted chain 
often mistaken for the hum in my mind. 
all i hear now is the cicada's whine 
and in its pauses a distant rush of cars 
climbing the hill to ancaster recedes, 
its mechanical dying like a far tide 
rolling from the solid land. maybe 
the spring's uncoiling is different than mine 
and i'm a red-breasted robin that's never 
left the latticework of limbs and leaves 
for the deepening dark sky and now is severed 
by consuming fire and a thick corrupting sleeve 
of bitter smoke, smoked out as though a beetle 
had emerged from dark wood thrown on a rising fire.
