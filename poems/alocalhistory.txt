my grandmother's house was always full of flies. 
they'd crawl across each other on the windowsill 
or would be spinning out their noisy dying 
everywhere, in such number, you could sweep forever 
and not get all the dead flies off the floor. out of the house 
and downhill, in a marsh of cattails and bristle-sided reeds, 
milkweed pods kept cracking open, leaking seed across the air, 
renewing the existence of their species 
in the way they'd done from year to year. 
way back when, some hard-handed methodist pioneer 
had somehow wrenched up every stone 
big enough to break a plough, 
and piled them all throughout the woods, 
where they still were, in mounds, when i was growing up: 
like barrows heaped above the decomposed remains 
of the violent saxon kings, whose grave-goods 
featured large in my imagination. 
my grandmother's gone. before she died, she lost her words, 
her house, her name, but for me, she's still a hard old woman 
walking downhill at dawn, long into autumn, 
to skinny-dip in her weed-choked, freezing pond. 
a hedge of wind, a wall of suburban snowâ€” 
my father's father's ashes are in the ground 
in southern ontario. something i read in college 
and for whatever reason have not forgotten 
is that the saxon barrow-makers, 
living among the wrecks of roman buildings 
they could not copy 
or restore, saw themselves as late arrivers, as an after-folk 
living on the graves of a greater folk 
who'd gone before. where is the horse, where the rider, 
some now-nameless saxon wrote, 
grieving for a people who his own forebears 
had annihilated, assimilated, 
or driven into the sea. 
the cree word for a body like mine is weesageechak
