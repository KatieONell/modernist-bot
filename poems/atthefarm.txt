i was sitting in the car counting the black flies 
they had come in through the open window 
there were four 
one was on the rear-view mirror 
the other three were perched on my left hand 
i heard a gunshot by the barn and thought nothing of it 
we were at a farm 
i saw a cow come charging forward with its head half gone 
a man with an axe came running behind it 
he hit it once 
once he hit it 
and it fell to the ground 
everything was eaten 
its eye appeared in a soup that night 
everything accounted for
