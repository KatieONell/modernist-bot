of our ancient people. 
ah 
an open moment, 
a prolonging 
of notice 
without reaction, a downward 
fountain of data, filling. 
unclosing, throat's 
wholeness, wide, 
to swallow 
the thrall of all of it: 
full bulge of gulp 
heldâ€” 
nothing undulating, no 
void vacuum 
pursuing a present cud 
through 
a human tunnel. 
sustained hum, 
sustenance 
pouring, not pulsing. 
rinse without erosion, 
flush without the closed 
push of peristalsis. 
clarity 
not needing blur 
to know itself. 
armadillo 
my lover spent his summer in the south, 
carving armadillos from their husks. it was, to hear him 
say it, an experienceâ€”the term people save 
for the places they hate. he spent june in the sunroom 
with a pitcher of sweet tea and a picture of me. 
by august, just the tea, watching hicks 
suck cigarettes through long, aristocratic 
sticks, papaya seeds stuck between their burnt 
sienna teeth. everything was burnt there. my lover 
carved years off his life with the very same knife 
the armadillos learned to fear. where are they 
now, i asked him as snowfall took care 
of the candles i'd lit. the not-quite-rodents, the not-quite-reptiles, 
not-quite-right gatecrashers of the ark? 
how does their nudity suit them? do they sigh 
all cool, how we sighed last year, when we threw our anoraks 
off and found we had that chalet to ourselves? 
if we were ever blameless, it was then. i held your locks 
in a chinese bun as you went south indeed, 
throwing, upon my balls, your tongue, how sea urchins 
throw their stomachs upon the coral reefs they eat. 
at which point my lover raised his knife 
to my hairline, scalped me masterfully and poured, 
into my open brain, a tea so cold and sweet. 
i am in love with your brother 
richie made me promise not to relate any stories of 
embarrassment or crime, but, richie, on 
this, the evening of your nuptials, i must tell them about 
our long day in truro. i just must. the fallacy then 
was a dark twin of tonight's fallacy, we 
and the dogsâ€”who are thought to be clairvoyant 
on these mattersâ€”anticipated storms 
that never came, and here we are now, beneath 
a tarpaulin, on an evening they reported 
would be clear and ideal for regattas. 
as truro woke, as truro's rodents spat their 
morning songs, richie came across my notebook, open 
to its core, and spotted my little admission: 
i am in love with your brother. 
the first line, i insisted, of a song i'd been arranging 
to be played on the wurlitzer, though now i 
come clean, richie, while your soul is at its smoothest 
and most forgiving, i did love him, the crimson acne 
flecked across his neck, he was like a man 
a guillotine had made an attempt at. 
we rolled that whole notebook into joints, didn't we, 
richie, then drove into the boonies to shove ammo 
into rifles folk left above their porch doors. 
that summer, your brother's motorboat 
slipped into the irish sea, his mannequin body 
demolished, and i'll bet he is here now, and is 
glad, i am sure of this. caroline, richie 
is one hell of a guy. you would do best to keep 
his body firmly in yours, how seas contain boats, 
for he is only stories to me now. 
the masturbating flowers 
ignore meâ€”i am frail today. 
if i tell you to stop 
walking, keep walking. if i ask 
for a piece of your nectarine, 
or press your palm 
against my chest, where the ribs sink 
most, where your come, months 
ago, would collect and grow cold, 
keep walking. all around us, 
library books used to wilt and expire, 
and if we were outside, 
the masturbating flowers 
would bite their filthy lips. 
sitting in the narrow shadow 
of an infantile willow, 
with a paperback, and a highlighter 
to mark the words 
we wanted in our lives forever. 
the penultimate embrace, abbreviated 
by such factors as the arrival 
of the streetcar and the heterosexual gaze. 
the ultimate, unabbreviated: a decadence 
of unclean teeth. i've since begun flossing. 
there's blood sometimes so oral 
has been taken off the table. 
a raw gum is a head wound, like any 
other, a door a blight loves the sight of. 
it gets men all choleric, though. 
in the yellow light, with their yellow feet, 
they push my body away. 
the pinata 
they came to strike the pinata. 
the piã±ata hung from a crane 
and swayed, its swollen gut 
of newspaper and paste. 
they listened as the piã±ata creaked, 
a dock in choppy waters. 
they began to shout themselves to the brink. 
and standing there, watching the piã±ata, 
it seemed almost possible 
to forget the search that had continued 
since christmas, was it this one 
or the one before? 
parks, rivers, cupboards, drawers, 
the bent light beneath their decksâ€” 
what had they found? 
and standing there, the piã±ata swaying, 
they were gathered and ready 
with hammers, bats, knives and chains 
to smash and tear until the piã±ata's shanks 
could be nipped by dogs. 
though when the first seam split, 
some resorted to doubling over 
and pawing the grass. 
while others continued taking swings, 
the halved ones moved with new insistence, 
their hands sweeping over the ground 
like visible winds. 
song for the field behind mississauga valley public school 
the field that stretched beyond 
goalposts. the field that redrew 
lines in us. 
like the field in a glove save. 
a high-five. the field in a radio hit, 
its raised seating. 
or, the field in waiting. the field in hunger. 
the field in a fifth beer, a wrong turn, 
the field in the little scar 
on your neighbour's forehead. 
the field in every abandoned thing 
we found in that field. in every bent putter. 
torn jacket. set of keys. 
the field in forgetting. in debt. 
the internet 
i first heard about it in a burger king. 
its aims seemed as elusive as the stock ticker 
or why some people stayed in marriages. 
the future was flying cars, phone screens, and minidisc. 
i bused tables with a cloth that mucked the laminate sheen 
and, just that spring, an annular eclipse ringed the sky 
like we were suddenly looking down a cabled conduit. 
then, as if an indigenous strain moving beyond a range map, 
people started getting it, birdsong calling up from basements, 
the pink noise, hiss, and crackle of a connection made. 
and somebody already had some pictures: the body, 
pixelated, bare, with the feeling you were overseeing it, 
moving along the conveyer belt of banner ads. 
days went by like they were being dragged into a bin. 
somewhere, fibers tethered us to a warehouse or a factory, 
but for then the feed seemed as ephemeral as a thought. 
the search bar like a mail slot you could lift 
just enough to see inside somebody else's space. 
it wasn't a place, but you could go there. 
at night, blinds down, but windows open, flags of light 
were quietly raised from main floors up into our rooms. 
foley artist 
this is the sound i was trying to make: 
in the film in the film, they're shooting a big-budget prequel to jaws, 
but the rubber shark heads are being eaten by a real-life shark. 
the sound of the rubber pieces being chewedâ€” 
not easy, but i'd done harder and worse. 
which makes me think. i knew a boy named kevin 
when i was too young to know the difference 
between rubber and real, though rubber is real, 
and kevin knew a place to hide in the valley so good 
that no one ever found him though he kept appearing 
startling people in their sliding doors. he was locked in the glass 
as if he'd done something so sinister his punishment 
needed flair to amuse the ones who'd been wronged. 
once, though, someone snapped a photo 
and swore it was kevin there, watchingâ€”we all knew 
it was bunk, the person knew too, but then we started 
talking about it: do you remember that time 
i stuck a pin in his waterbed for no reason really 
or the time he got dressed up as his mother but not in her clothes? 
we retrieved the old albums, unpacked the taped boxes, 
found the one botched life-sized drawing 
he'd done of himself and completed it 
together as a neighbourhood, a district, a city, 
practically a nation at this point, and then a sort of galaxy 
expanding outward at a speed so great that when kevin 
walked out of the picture with a boom 
it almost wasn't a surprise, so fast were we movingâ€¦ 
but kevin was back, and he shook our hands, 
revealed the crevice he'd made in the dirt 
and told everyone sorry for pulling this stunt. 
and then he lived his long life. he married, 
had children, difficult years, divorced, rebuiltâ€” 
and double back to the start again on this slight tilt: 
in the film in the film they don't need to add any sounds 
to the mix because the shark that swims in and chews up 
all our likenesses is already perfectly captured. 
voodoo hypothesis 
before sight, we imagine 
that while they go out in search 
of god 
we stay in and become god, 
become: curiosity, 
whose soul is a nuclear battery 
because she'll pulverize martian rock 
and test for organic molecules 
in her lab within a lab within 
a lab. she doesn't need to know our fears 
so far too grand for ontology, reckoning. 
did you not land with your rocket behind 
you, hope beyond hope on the tip of your rope 
with the kindness of antigravity slowing you down, 
you, before me, metal and earthen. but i am here to 
confirm or deny, the millions of small 
things that seven minutes of success were hinged upon 
when i was little more than idea and research, 
in the hypnotic gestures of flame and bunsen burner, 
and into parachute 
no one foresaw, the bag of rags at the end 
of the tunnelâ€”all memory now, 
this paraclete. 
where else is a pocket 
of air more deadly than the atomic bomb? 
would this only happen on earth? 
has mars run out of tolerance for the minutiae 
of air pockets, fingerprints and worry? 
aggregates of metal, curiosity 
and her clues to calm our fears for what's coming. 
mars and her epic storms, her gargantuan 
volcanoes have long ceased their trembling, 
her crazy flooded planes, frozen and in cinema. 
martian life now earth and revelation's phases: 
earth problem, not mars problem. 
but why 
should i unravel over all this remembering? 
great thing about landing 
is that i've arrived 
at your service, at your sand, at your valley 
and unsentimental magma. 
before me screams planes like mojave desert, waikiki, nagasaki, 
nothing too strange to keep curiosity off course. 
even though the viking missions found no conclusive pulse 
and we declared you dead, o mars, 
never mind that we named your heights and depths 
from orbit. and from your spheres of minerals 
where oceans once roaredâ€”we've learned little 
of your lenience for empire. 
forgive us what spirit uncovered in the silica of your ancient hot springs.
