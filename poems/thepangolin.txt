another armored animal—scale 
lapping scale with spruce-cone regu- 
larity until they 
form the uninterrupted central 
tail-row. this near artichoke 
with head and legs and grit-equipped giz- 
zard, the night miniature artist- 
engineer, is    leonardo’s 
indubitable son? im- 
pressive animal 
and toiler, of whom we seldom hear. 
armor seems extra. but for him, 
the closing ear- 
ridge—or bare 
ear, lacking even this small 
eminence—and similarly safe 
contracting nose and eye apertures 
impenetrably closable, 
are not;—a true ant-eat- 
er, not cockroach-eater, who endures 
exhausting solitary 
trips through unfamiliar ground at night, 
returning before sunrise; stepping 
in the moonlight,    on the moonlight 
peculiarly, that the out- 
side edges of his 
hands may bear the weight and save the claws 
for digging. serpentined about 
the tree, he draws 
away from 
danger unpugnaciously, 
with no sound but a harmless hiss; keep- 
ing the fragile grace of the thomas- 
of-leighton-buzzard westminster 
abbey wrought-iron vine, or 
rolls himself into a ball that has 
power to defy all effort 
to unroll it;—strongly intailed, neat 
head for core, on neck not breaking off, 
with curled-in feet. nevertheless 
he has sting-proof scales; and nest 
of rocks closed with earth 
from inside, which he can thus darken. 
sun and moon \& day and night \& man and beast 
each with a splen- 
dor which man 
in all his vileness cannot 
set aside; each with an excellence! 
"fearful yet to be feared," the armored 
ant-eater met by the driver 
ant does not turn back, but 
engulfs what he can, the flattened sword- 
edged leafpoints on the tail and 
artichoke-set leg and body plates 
quivering violently when it 
retaliates    and swarms on him. 
compact like the furled fringed frill 
on the hat-brim of 
gargallo’s hollow iron head of a 
matador, he will drop and will 
then walk away 
unhurt, al- 
though if unintruded on 
he will come slowly down the tree, helped 
by his tail. the giant-pangolin 
tail, graceful tool, as prop or hand 
or broom or axe, tipped like 
the elephant’s trunk with special skin, 
is not lost on this ant and 
stone swallowing uninjurable 
artichoke, which simpletons thought a 
living fable    whom the stones had 
nourished whereas ants had done 
so. pangolins are 
not aggressive animals; between 
dusk and day, they have the not un- 
chainlike, machine- 
like form and 
frictionless creep of a thing 
made graceful by adversities, con- 
versities. to explain grace requires 
a curious hand. if that which 
is at all were not for 
ever, why would those who graced the spires 
with animals and gathered 
there to rest, on cold luxurious 
low stone seats—a monk and monk and monk— 
between the thus ingenious roof- 
supports, have slaved to confuse 
grace with a kindly 
manner, time in which to pay a debt, 
the cure for sins, a graceful use 
of what are yet 
approved stone 
mullions branching out across 
the perpendiculars? a sailboat 
was the first machine. the manis, made 
for moving quietly also, 
is neither a prisoner 
nor a god; on hind feet plantigrade, 
with certain postures of a 
man. beneath sun and moon, man slaving 
to make his life more sweet, leaves half the 
flowers worth having,    needing to choose 
wisely how to use the strength;— 
a paper-maker 
like the wasp; a tractor of food-stuffs, 
like the ant; spidering a length 
of web from bluffs 
above a 
stream; in fighting, mechanicked 
like the pangolin; capsizing in 
disheartenment. bedizened or stark 
naked, man, the self, the being 
so-called human, writingmaster 
to this world, griffons a dark 
"like does not like like that is 
obnoxious"; and writes errror with four 
r’s. among animals, one has a 
sense of humor    then, which saves a 
few steps, which saves years—unig- 
norant, modest and 
unemotional, and all emo- 
tion; one with everlasting vig- 
or, power to grow 
though there are 
few of him—who can make one 
breathe faster, and make one erecter. 
not afraid of anything is he 
and then goes cowering forth, tread paced 
to meet an obstacle 
at every step. consistent with the 
formula—warm blood, no gills, 
two pairs of hands and a few hairs—that 
is a mammal; there he sits in his 
own habitat,    serge-clad, strong-shod. 
the prey of fear; he, always 
curtailed, extinguished, 
thwarted by the dusk, work partly done, 
says to the alternating blaze, 
"again the sun! 
anew each 
day; and new and new and new, 
that comes into and steadies my soul.
