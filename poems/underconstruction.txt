you'd think that empty lot 
had slaughtered their 
mothers the way those 
men torture it 
with yellow machines. with how 
little sleep you've been 
getting, you think a lot 
of sinister things, especially 
these mornings when light 
is the translucent grey 
of fake teeth. your dad 
used to bring you home 
dinosaur bones from the states 
he razed to lay highways. 
you can't remember when 
you realized trucks run 
on a broth of ancient lizards 
but now they'll never not 
feel haunted. it's important 
to get places but you 
doubt another condo tower 
beside the train line 
will do more than rattle 
like a yahtzee cup tossing 
professional couples. 
you keep the fossils 
like jewellery on your dresser, 
stroke their tar settings 
until they look wet. a view, 
more sleep, a new life 
with fewer machines— 
you've wanted so 
much for so long you 
don't remember living 
without the fuel light on. 
an invisible raptor stands 
behind you in a business 
suit, factoring in inflation 
with his talon on your hand.
