beside me a woman moves her lips 
and i wonder if she's praying. 
with his stunted machine 
gun the checkpoint soldier waves 
us down, stilling the drum and creak 
of the tro-tro bus. in front of me 
tightly strapped to a woman in bright 
aqua homecoming cloth, a baby 
stops gurgling, lays his head 
down on her brown back, 
closes his eyes. we file out into 
a heat and red dust field. 
a guardhouse, thin and shaky 
like the soldiers, crumbling mud 
walls, tin roof half ripped open 
like a can of smoked oysters. 
from somewhere, more guards 
appear, more guns with taped-on 
crescent-shaped magazines. 
the one who waved us in walks 
down the line, stopping at a watch, 
shirt collar, face, as though 
inspecting troops in the independence 
day parade. reeking of palm 
wine, he sways and his dented 
gun sways. beside me a woman 
moves her lips and i wonder 
if she's praying. someone's got 
enough of what the soldiers want 
and what is it. from her cloth bag 
i smell pepper-smoke, dried fish. 
the noon sun hits. who among us 
won't get back on the bus? 
peering at a child's sandals, the soldier 
leans over too far, hitting 
the red dirt hard. we don't say 
anything. another soldier shouts 
and points at the fallen man 
and the soldiers all laugh. 
the one on the ground curses, 
leans heavily on his gun 
like a field hockey player getting 
back on his feet. but he's 
not a hockey player. 
and that's when it starts.
