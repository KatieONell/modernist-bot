cowed by his uningenious will 
of dragon-like demeanor, till 
it left them orphans. 
his foibles clustered underneath 
him, dominated by a wreath 
of upright half notes. 
encumbered as he was with pride, 
but for that coat he might have died 
so despicably 
that kindness might have seemed unkind 
had not the garment been designed 
to serve two masters.
