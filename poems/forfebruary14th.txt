saint valentine, 
although late, would "some interested law 
impelled to plod in the poem’s cause" 
be unwelcome with a line? 
might you have liked a stone 
from a de beers consolidated mine? 
or badger-neat saber-thronged thistle 
of palestine—the leaves alone 
down’d underneath, 
worth a touch? or that mimosa-leafed vine 
called an "alexander’s armillary 
sphere" fanning out in a wreath? 
or did the ark 
preserve paradise-birds with jet-black plumes, 
whose descendants might serve as presents? 
but questioning is the mark 
of a pest! why think 
only of animals in connection 
with the ark or the wine noah drank? 
but that the ark did not sink.
