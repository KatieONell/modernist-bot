i was in a bar between duckworth and water 
on my way through a hooting mob 
of clappers and stompers, 
a swaying mass of drunk post-teens, 
when this kid, bespectacled, barely 
a sliver of bark off a birch rod, 
pitched suddenly forward 
as if standing on the deck 
of a ship in heavy seas. 
i caught him as he fell, 
and ducking under an arm, 
dragged him to the exit 
like simon towing christ's 
cross down the road. 
turns out he'd fallen earlier, 
lost his footing in a puddle of beer 
and struck the edge of a table. 
now, three drinks later, he was slipping 
beneath whatever we take to be 
our conscious lives. no matter. 
i slung him on the steps across the way 
and went to ring an ambulance, 
the kid jerking like a dreaming dog 
on the hot scent of rabbits; 
frothing at the mouth now, rabid. 
when i came back out, 
good samaritan, glad to be of help, 
he was chatting up a pair of girls, 
pants piss-stained. 
i told him about the ambulance. 
he said, i don't know what's wrong 
with me. i don't know either. 
what's wrong with any of us, i mean.
