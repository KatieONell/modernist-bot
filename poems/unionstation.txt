two point five metres beyond herself, 
the octopus cannot see. all retinae shoot radii— 
mine, for instance, tell me there's no lover here, 
not even to my side. this is the longest room 
i occupy with any regularity, train tracks going on upon 
an indoor horizon. back here, we seers-off 
stand straight beside an expanse no hairstring of neurons 
would survive a serious fathoming of. 
it causes a longing, a pressurized pinch 
the valsalva maneuver could not 
slough off. if showing signs of boredom, the octopus 
is handed an eyeless, noseless, 
mouthless, earless, moustacheless mr. potato head. 
in her final year, she dotes 
on empty eggs. in the pan, she really shrinks. how do we 
measure her peripheral 
limits in imperial units? eight feet exactly. you can't 
make this stuff up. 
when you're the one watching, not taking up air in, 
the train, time 
passes notionally, how it's said to pass on a coastal 
periphery. 
but some things that are getting smaller really are getting 
smaller 
and some are just getting away.
