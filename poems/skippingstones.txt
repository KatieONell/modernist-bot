i fling flat stones into the surf, corral 
my anger in the strangely angled pose. 
each beat's concentric blip a sound so odd 
it clarifies the brine to mellow blues. 
my mother's ex once skimmed his bottle caps 
down at the lake; not littering, i thought, 
the glinting disc's fourteen discrete hop-hops. 
now i trust black, the solid strength of rock. 
my hand must learn the pebble's weight, and know 
which chips will change the shape and spoil the trick; 
this can't be accurately guessed, and though 
some seem to work without my gauging it; 
i fling them to new ocean bottom homes, 
and some i leave to dry upon the beach. skip stones.
