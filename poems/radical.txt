tapering 
to a point, conserving everything, 
this carrot is predestined to be thick. 
the world is 
but a circumstance, a mis- 
erable corn-patch for its feet. with ambition, imagination, outgrowth, 
nutriment, 
with everything crammed belligerent- 
ly inside itself, its fibers breed mon- 
opolyâ€” 
a tail-like, wedge-shaped engine with the 
secret of expansion, fused with intensive heat to color of the set- 
ting sun and 
stiff. for the man in the straw hat, stand- 
ing still and turning to look back at it, 
as much as 
to say my happiest moment has 
been funereal in comparison with this, the conditions of life pre- 
determined 
slavery to be easy and freedom hard. for 
it? dismiss 
agrarian lore; it tells him this: 
that which it is impossible to force, it is impossible 
to hinder.
