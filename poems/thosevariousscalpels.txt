those 
various sounds consistently indistinct, like intermingled echoes 
struck from thin glasses successively at randomâ€”the 
inflection disguised: your hair, the tails of two fighting-cocks head to head in stoneâ€”like sculptured scimitars re- 
peating the curve of your ears in reverse order: your eyes, flowers of ice 
and 
snow sown by tearing winds on the cordage of disabled ships: your raised hand 
an ambiguous signature: your cheeks, those rosettes 
of blood on the stone floors of french chã¢teaux, with regard to which the guides are so affirmative: 
your other hand 
a 
bundle of lances all alike, partly hid by emeralds from persia 
and the fractional magnificence of florentine 
goldworkâ€”a collection of half a dozen little objects made fine 
with enamel in gray, yellow, and dragon fly blue; a lemon, a 
pear 
and three bunches of grapes, tied with silver: your dress, a magnificent square 
cathedral of uniform 
and at the same time, diverse appearanceâ€”a species of vertical vineyard rustling in the storm 
of conventional opinion. are they weapons or scalpels? whetted 
to 
brilliance by the hard majesty of that sophistication which is su- 
perior to opportunity, these things are rich 
instruments with which to experiment but surgery is not tentative. why dissect destiny with instruments which 
are more highly specialized than the tissues of destiny itself? 
new york 
the savageâ€™s romance, 
accreted where we need the space for commerceâ€” 
the center of the wholesale fur trade, 
starred with tepees of ermine and peopled with foxes, 
the long guard-hairs waving two inches beyond the body of the pelt; 
the ground dotted with deer-skinsâ€”white with white spots 
"as satin needlework in a single color may carry a varied pattern," 
and wilting eaglesâ€™ down compacted by the wind; 
and picardels of beaver skin; white ones alert with snow. 
it is a far cry from the "queen full of jewels" 
and the beau with the muff, 
from the gilt coach shaped like a perfume bottle, 
to the conjunction of the monongahela and the allegheny, 
and the scholastic philosophy of the wilderness 
to combat which one must stand outside and laugh 
since to go in is to be lost. 
it is not the dime-novel exterior, 
niagara falls, the calico horses and the war canoe; 
it is not that "if the fur is not finer than such as one sees others wear, 
one would rather be without itâ€”" 
that estimated in raw meat and berries, we could feed the universe; 
it is not the atmosphere of ingenuity, 
the otter, the beaver, the puma skins 
without shooting-irons or dogs; 
it is not the plunder, 
it is the "accessibility to experience. 
peopleâ€™s surroundings 
they answer oneâ€™s questions: 
a deal table compact with the wall; 
in this dried bone of arrangement, 
oneâ€™s "natural promptness" is compressed, not crowded out; 
oneâ€™s style is not lost in such simplicity: 
the palace furniture, so old fashioned, so old fashionable; 
sã¨vres china and the fireplace dogsâ€” 
bronze dromios with pointed ears, as obsolete as pugs; 
one has oneâ€™s preference in the matter of bad furniture 
and this is not oneâ€™s choice: 
the vast indestructible necropolis 
of composite yawman-erbe separable units; 
the steel, the oak, the glass, the poor richard publications 
containing the public secrets of efficiency 
on "paper so thin that one thousand four hundred and twenty pages make one inch," 
exclaiming so to speak, when you take my time, you take something i had meant to use: 
the highway hid by fir trees in rhododendron twenty feet deep, 
the peacocks, hand-forged gates, old persian velvetâ€” 
roses outlined in pale black on an ivory groundâ€” 
the pierced iron shadows of the cedars, 
chinese carved glass, old waterford, 
lettered ladies; landscape gardening twisted into permanence: 
straight lines over such great distances as one finds in utah or in texas 
where people do not have to be told 
that "a good brake is as important as a good motor," 
where by means of extra sense cells in the skin, 
they can like trout, smell what is comingâ€” 
those cool sirs with the explicit sensory apparatus of common sense, 
who know the exact distance between two points as the crow flies; 
there is something attractive about a mind that moves in a straight lineâ€” 
the municipal bat-roost of mosquito warfare, concrete statuary, 
medicaments for "instant beauty" in the hands of all, 
and that live wire, the american string quartet: 
and bluebeardâ€™s tower above the coral reefs, 
the magic mousetrap closing on all points of the compass, 
capping like petrified surf, the furious azure of the bay 
where there is no dust and life is like a lemon-leaf, 
a green piece of tough translucent parchment, 
where the crimson, the copper, and the chinese vermilion of the poincianas 
set fire to the masonry and turquoise blues refute the clock; 
this dungeon with odd notions of hospitality, 
with its "chessmen carved out of moonstones," 
its mocking-birds, fringed lilies, and hibiscus, 
its black butterflies with blue half circles on their wings, 
tan goats with onyx ears, its lizards glittering and without thickness 
like splashes of fire and silver on the pierced turquoise of the lattices 
and the acacia-like lady shivering at the touch of a hand, 
lost in a small collision of the orchidsâ€” 
dyed quicksilver let fall 
to disappear like an obedient chameleon in fifty shades of mauve and amethyst: 
here where the mind of this establishment has come to the conclusion 
that it would be impossible to revolve about oneâ€™s self too much, 
sophistication has like "an escalator, cut the nerve of progress." 
in these noncommittal, personal-impersonal expressions of appearance, 
the eye knows what to skip; 
the physiognomy of conduct must not reveal the skeleton; 
"a setting must not have the air of being one" 
yet with x-raylike inquisitive intensity upon it, the surfaces go back; 
the interfering fringes of expression are but a stain on what stands out, 
there is neither up nor down to it; 
we see the exterior and the fundamental structureâ€” 
captains of armies, cooks, carpenters, 
cutlers, gamesters, surgeons and armorers, 
lapidaries, silkmen, glovers, fiddlers and ballad-singers, 
sextons of churches, dyers of black cloth, hostlers and chimney-sweeps, 
queens, countesses, ladies, emperors, travelers and mariners, 
dukes, princes and gentlemen 
in their respective placesâ€” 
camps, forges and battlefields, 
conventions, oratories and wardrobes, 
dens, deserts, railway stations, asylums and places where engines are made, 
shops, prisons, brickyards and altars of churchesâ€” 
in magnificent places clean and decent, 
castles, palaces, dining-halls, theatres and imperial audience-chambers. 
snakes, mongooses, snake-charmers, and the like 
i have a friend who would give a price for those long fingers all of one lengthâ€” 
those hideous birdâ€™s claws, for that exotic asp and the mongooseâ€” 
products of the country in which everything is hard work, the country of the grass-getter, 
the torch-bearer, the dog-servant, the message-bearer, the holy-man. 
engrossed in this distinguished worm nearly as wild and as fierce as the day it was captured, 
he gazes as if incapable of looking at anything with a view to analysis. 
"the slight snake rippling quickly through the grass, 
the leisurely tortoise with its pied back, 
the chameleon passing from twig to stone, from stone to straw," 
lit his imagination at one time; his admiration now converges upon this: 
thick, not heavy, it stands up from its traveling-basket, 
the essentially greek, the plastic animal, all of a piece from nose to tail; 
one is compelled to look at it as at the shadows of the alps 
imprisoning in their folds like flies in amber, the rhythms of the skating-rink. 
this animal to which from the earliest times, importance has attached, 
fine as its worshippers have saidâ€”for what was it invented? 
to show that when intelligence in its pure form 
has embarked on a train of thought which is unproductive, it will come back? 
we do not know; the only positive thing about it is its shape, but why protest? 
the passion for setting people right is in itself an afflictive disease. 
distaste which takes no credit to itself is best. 
bowls 
on the green 
with lignum vitae balls and ivory markers, 
the pins planted in wild duck formation, 
and quickly dispersed: 
by this survival of ancient punctilio 
in the manner of chinese lacquer carving, 
layer after layer exposed by certainty of touch and unhurried incision 
so that only so much color shall be revealed as is necessary to the picture 
i learn that we are precisiansâ€” 
not citizens of pompeii arrested in action 
as a cross section of oneâ€™s correspondence would seem to imply. 
renouncing a policy of boorish indifference 
to everything that has been said since the days of matilda, 
i shall purchase an etymological dictionary of modern english 
that i may understand what is written 
and like the ant and the spider 
returning from time to time to headquarters, 
shall answer the question 
as to "why i like winter better than i like summer" 
and acknowledge that it does not make me sick 
to look modern playwrights and poets and novelists straight in the faceâ€” 
that i feel just the same; 
and i shall write to the publisher of the magazine 
which will "appear the first day of the month 
and disappear before one has had time to buy it 
unless one takes proper precaution," 
and make an effort to pleaseâ€” 
since he who gives quickly gives twice 
in nothing so much as in a letter. 
novices 
anatomize their work 
in the sense in which will honeycomb was jilted by a duchess, 
the little assumptions of the scared ego confusing the issue 
so that they do not know "whether it is the buyer or the seller who gives the money"â€” 
an abstruse idea plain to none but the artist, 
the only seller who buys, and holds on to the money. 
because one expresses oneself and entitles it wisdom, one is not a fool. what an idea! 
"dracontine cockatrices, perfect and poisonous from the beginning," 
they present themselves as a contrast to sea-serpented regions "unlit by the half-lights of more conscious art." 
acquiring at thirty what at sixty they will be trying to forget, 
blind to the right word, deaf to satire 
which like "the smell of the cypress strengthens the nerves of the brain," 
averse from the antique 
with "that tinge of sadness about it which a reflective mind always feels, 
it is so little and so much"â€” 
they write the sort of thing that would in their judgment interest a lady; 
curious to know if we do not adore each letter of the alphabet that goes to make a word of itâ€” 
according to the act of congress, the sworn statement of the treasurer and all the rest of itâ€” 
the counterpart to what we are: 
stupid man; men are strong and no one pays any attention: 
stupid woman; women have charm and how annoying they can be. 
yes, "the authors are wonderful people, particularly those that write the most," 
the masters of all languages, the supertadpoles of expression. 
accustomed to the recurring phosphorescence of antiquity, 
the "much noble vagueness and indefinite jargon" of plato, 
the lucid movements of the royal yacht upon the learned scenery of egyptâ€” 
king, steward, and harper seated amidships while the jade and the rock crystal course about in solution, 
their suavity surmounts the surfâ€” 
the willowy wit, the transparent equation of isaiah, jeremiah, ezekiel, daniel. 
bored by "the detailless perspective of the sea," reiterative and naive, 
and its chaos of rocksâ€”the stuffy remarks of the hebrewsâ€” 
the good and alive young men demonstrate the assertion 
that it is not necessary to be associated with that which has bored one; 
they have never made a statement which they found so easy to proveâ€” 
"split like a glass against a wall" 
in this "precipitate of dazzling impressions, 
the spontaneous unforced passion of the hebrew languageâ€” 
an abyss of verbs full of reverberations and tempestuous energy," 
in which action perpetuates action and angle is at variance with angle 
till submerged by the general action; 
obscured by "fathomless suggestions of color," 
by incessantly panting lines of green, white with concussion, 
in this drama of water against rocksâ€”this "ocean of hurrying consonants" 
with its "great livid stains like long slabs of green marble," 
its "flashing lances of perpendicular lightning" and "molten fires swallowed up," 
"with foam on its barriers," 
"crashing itself out in one long hiss of spray. 
marriage 
this institution, 
perhaps one should say enterprise 
out of respect for which 
one says one need not change oneâ€™s mind 
about a thing one has believed in, 
requiring public promises 
of oneâ€™s intention 
to fulfill a private obligation: 
i wonder what adam and eve 
think of it by this time, 
this firegilt steel 
alive with goldenness; 
how bright it showsâ€” 
"of circular traditions and impostures, 
committing many spoils," 
requiring all oneâ€™s criminal ingenuity 
to avoid! 
psychology which explains everything 
explains nothing 
and we are still in doubt. 
eve: beautiful womanâ€” 
i have seen her 
when she was so handsome 
she gave me a start, 
able to write simultaneously 
in three languagesâ€” 
english, german and french 
and talk in the meantime; 
equally positive in demanding a commotion 
and in stipulating quiet: 
"i should like to be alone"; 
to which the visitor replies, 
"i should like to be alone; 
why not be alone together?" 
below the incandescent stars 
below the incandescent fruit, 
the strange experience of beauty; 
its existence is too much; 
it tears one to pieces 
and each fresh wave of consciousness 
is poison. 
"see her, see her in this common world," 
the central flaw 
in that first crystal-fine experiment, 
this amalgamation which can never be more 
than an interesting impossibility, 
describing it 
as "that strange paradise 
unlike flesh, gold, or stately buildings, 
the choicest piece of my life: 
the heart rising 
in its estate of peace 
as a boat rises 
with the rising of the water"; 
constrained in speaking of the serpentâ€” 
that shed snakeskin in the history of politeness 
not to be returned to againâ€” 
that invaluable accident 
exonerating adam. 
and he has beauty also; 
itâ€™s distressingâ€”the o thou 
to whom, from whom, 
without whom nothingâ€”adam; 
"something feline, 
something colubrine"â€”how true! 
a crouching mythological monster 
in that persian miniature of emerald mines, 
raw silkâ€”ivory white, snow white, 
oyster white and six othersâ€” 
that paddock full of leopards and giraffesâ€” 
long lemon-yellow bodies 
sown with trapezoids of blue. 
alive with words, 
vibrating like a cymbal 
touched before it has been struck, 
he has prophesied correctlyâ€” 
the industrious waterfall, 
"the speedy stream 
which violently bears all before it, 
at one time silent as the air 
and now as powerful as the wind." 
"treading chasms 
on the uncertain footing of a spear," 
forgetting that there is in woman 
a quality of mind 
which as an instinctive manifestation 
is unsafe, 
he goes on speaking 
in a formal, customary strain 
of "past states, the present state, 
seals, promises, 
the evil one suffered, 
the good one enjoys, 
hell, heaven, 
everything convenient 
to promote oneâ€™s joy." 
there is in him a state of mind 
by force of which, 
perceiving what it was not 
intended that he should, 
"he experiences a solemn joy 
in seeing that he has become an idol." 
plagued by the nightingale 
in the new leaves, 
with its silenceâ€” 
not its silence but its silences, 
he says of it: 
"it clothes me with a shirt of fire." 
"he dares not clap his hands 
to make it go on 
lest it should fly off; 
if he does nothing, it will sleep; 
if he cries out, it will not understand." 
unnerved by the nightingale 
and dazzled by the apple, 
impelled by "the illusion of a fire 
effectual to extinguish fire," 
compared with which 
the shining of the earth 
is but deformityâ€”a fire 
"as high as deep as bright as broad 
as long as life itself," 
he stumbles over marriage, 
"a very trivial object indeed" 
to have destroyed the attitude 
in which he stoodâ€” 
the ease of the philosopher 
unfathered by a woman. 
unhelpful hymen! 
"a kind of overgrown cupid" 
reduced to insignificance 
by the mechanical advertising 
parading as involuntary comment, 
by that experiment of adamâ€™s 
with ways out but no way inâ€” 
the ritual of marriage, 
augmenting all its lavishness; 
its fiddle-head ferns, 
lotus flowers, opuntias, white dromedaries, 
its hippopotamusâ€” 
nose and mouth combined 
in one magnificent hopper, 
"the crested screamerâ€” 
that huge bird almost a lizard," 
its snake and the potent apple. 
he tells us 
that "for love 
that will gaze an eagle blind, 
that is like a hercules 
climbing the trees 
in the garden of the hesperides, 
from forty-five to seventy 
is the best age," 
commending it 
as a fine art, as an experiment, 
a duty or as merely recreation. 
one must not call him ruffian 
nor friction a calamityâ€” 
the fight to be affectionate: 
"no truth can be fully known 
until it has been tried 
by the tooth of disputation." 
the blue panther with black eyes, 
the basalt panther with blue eyes, 
entirely gracefulâ€” 
one must give them the pathâ€” 
the black obsidian diana 
who "darkeneth her countenance 
as a bear doth, 
causing her husband to sigh," 
the spiked hand 
that has an affection for one 
and proves it to the bone, 
impatient to assure you 
that impatience is the mark of independence 
not of bondage. 
"married people often look that way"â€” 
"seldom and cold, up and down, 
mixed and malarial 
with a good day and bad." 
"when do we feed?" 
we occidentals are so unemotional, 
we quarrel as we feed; 
oneâ€™s self quite lost, 
the irony preserved 
in "the ahasuerus tãªte ã tãªte banquet" 
with its "good monster, lead the way," 
with little laughter 
and munificence of humor 
in that quixotic atmosphere of frankness 
in which "four oâ€™clock does not exist 
but at five oâ€™clock 
the ladies in their imperious humility 
are ready to receive you"; 
in which experience attests 
that men have power 
and sometimes one is made to feel it. 
he says, "what monarch would not blush 
to have a wife 
with hair like a shaving-brush? 
the fact of woman 
is not â€˜the sound of the flute 
but very poison." 
she says, "â€˜men are monopolists 
of stars, garters, buttons 
and other shining baublesâ€™â€” 
unfit to be the guardians 
of another personâ€™s happiness." 
he says, "these mummies 
must be handled carefullyâ€” 
â€˜the crumbs from a lionâ€™s meal, 
a couple of shins and the bit of an earâ€™; 
turn to the letter m 
and you will find 
that â€˜a wife is a coffin,â€™ 
that severe object 
with the pleasing geometry 
stipulating space and not people, 
refusing to be buried 
and uniquely disappointing, 
revengefully wrought in the attitude 
of an adoring child 
to a distinguished parent." 
she says, "this butterfly, 
this waterfly, this nomad 
that has â€˜proposed 
to settle on my hand for life.â€™â€” 
what can one do with it? 
there must have been more time 
in shakespeareâ€™s day 
to sit and watch a play. 
you know so many artists who are fools." 
he says, "you know so many fools 
who are not artists." 
the fact forgot 
that "some have merely rights 
while some have obligations," 
he loves himself so much, 
he can permit himself 
no rival in that love. 
she loves herself so much, 
she cannot see herself enoughâ€” 
a statuette of ivory on ivory, 
the logical last touch 
to an expansive splendor 
earned as wages for work done: 
one is not rich but poor 
when one can always seem so right. 
what can one do for themâ€” 
these savages 
condemned to disaffect 
all those who are not visionaries 
alert to undertake the silly task 
of making people noble? 
this model of petrine fidelity 
who "leaves her peaceful husband 
only because she has seen enough of him"â€“ 
that orator reminding you, 
"i am yours to command." 
"everything to do with love is mystery; 
it is more than a dayâ€™s work 
to investigate this science." 
one sees that it is rareâ€” 
that striking grasp of opposites 
opposed each to the other, not to unity, 
which in cycloid inclusiveness 
has dwarfed the demonstration 
of columbus with the eggâ€” 
a triumph of simplicityâ€” 
that charitive euroclydon 
of frightening disinterestedness 
which the world hates, 
admitting: 
"i am such a cow, 
if i had a sorrow, 
i should feel it a long time; 
i am not one of those 
who have a great sorrow 
in the morning 
and a great joy at noon"; 
which says: "i have encountered it 
among those unpretentious 
protegã©s of wisdom, 
where seeming to parade 
as the debater and the roman, 
the statesmanship 
of an archaic daniel webster 
persists to their simplicity of temper 
as the essence of the matter: 
â€˜liberty and union 
now and foreverâ€™; 
the book on the writing-table; 
the hand in the breast-pocket. 
silence 
my father used to say, 
"superior people never make long visits, 
have to be shown longfellowâ€™s grave 
nor the glass flowers at harvard. 
self reliant like the catâ€” 
that takes its prey to privacy, 
the mouseâ€™s limp tail hanging like a shoelace from its mouthâ€” 
they sometimes enjoy solitude, 
and can be robbed of speech 
by speech which has delighted them. 
the deepest feeling always shows itself in silence; 
not in silence, but restraint." 
nor was he insincere in saying, "â€˜make my house your inn.â€™" 
inns are not residences. 
an octopus 
of ice. deceptively reserved and flat, 
it lies "in grandeur and in mass" 
beneath a sea of shifting snow dunes; 
dots of cyclamen red and maroon on its clearly defined pseudopodia 
made of glass that will bendâ€”a much needed inventionâ€” 
comprising twenty-eight ice fields from fifty to five hundred feet thick, 
of unimagined delicacy. 
"picking periwinkles from the cracks" 
or killing prey with the concentric crushing rigor of the python, 
it hovers forward "spider fashion 
on its arms" misleadingly like lace; 
its "ghostly pallor changing 
to the green metallic tinge of an anemone starred pool." 
the fir trees in "the magnitude of their root systems," 
rise aloof from these maneuvers "creepy to behold," 
austere specimens of our american royal families, 
"each like the shadow of the one beside it. 
the rock seems frail compared with their dark energy of life," 
its vermilion and onyx and manganese blue interior expensiveness 
left at the mercy of the weather; 
"stained transversely by iron where the water drips down," 
recognized by its plants and its animals. 
completing a circle, 
you have been deceived into thinking that you have progressed, 
under the polite needles of the larches 
"hung to filter not to intercept the sunlight"â€” 
met by tightly wattled spruce twigs 
"conformed to an edge like clipped cypress 
as if no branch could penetrate the cold beyond its company"; 
and dumps of gold and silver ore enclosing the goatâ€™s mirrorâ€” 
that lady-fingerlike depression in the shape of the left human foot, 
which prejudices you in favor of itself 
before you have had time to see the others; 
its indigo, pea-green, blue-green, and turquoise, 
from a hundred to two hundred feet deep, 
"merging in irregular patches in the middle lake 
where like gusts of a storm 
obliterating the shadows of the fir trees, the wind makes lanes of ripples." 
what spot could have merits of equal importance 
for bears, elk, deer, wolves, goats, and ducks? 
preempted by their ancestors, 
this is the property of the exacting porcupine, 
and of the rat "slipping along to its burrow in the swamp 
or pausing on high ground to smell the heather"; 
of "thoughtful beavers 
making drains which seem the work of careful men with shovels," 
and of the bears inspecting unexpectedly 
ant hills and berry bushes. 
composed of calcium gems and alabaster pillars, 
topaz, tourmaline crystals and amethyst quartz, 
their den is somewhere else, concealed in the confusion 
of "blue forests thrown together with marble and jasper and agate 
as if whole quarries had been dynamited." 
and farther up, in stag-at-bay position 
as a scintillating fragment of these terrible stalagmites, 
stands the goat, 
its eye fixed on the waterfall which never seems to fallâ€” 
an endless skein swayed by the wind, 
immune to force of gravity in the perspective of the peaks. 
a special antelope 
acclimated to "grottoes from which issue penetrating draughts 
which make you wonder why you came," 
it stands its ground 
on cliffs the color of the clouds, of petrified white vaporâ€” 
black feet, eyes, nose, and horns engraved on dazzling ice-fields, 
the ermine body on the crystal peak; 
the sun kindling its shoulders to maximum heat like acetylene, dyeing them whiteâ€” 
upon this antique pedestalâ€” 
"a mountain with those graceful lines which prove it a volcano," 
its top a complete cone like fujiyamaâ€™s 
till an explosion blew it off. 
maintaining many minds, distinguished by a beauty 
of which "the visitor dare never fully speak at home 
for fear of being stoned as an imposter," 
big snow mountain is the home of a diversity of creatures: 
those who "have lived in hotels 
but who now live in campsâ€”who prefer to"; 
the mountain guide evolving from the trapper, 
"in two pairs of trousers, the outer one older, 
wearing slowly away from the feet to the knees"; 
"the nine-striped chipmunk 
running with unmammallike agility along a log"; 
the water ouzel 
with "its passion for rapids and high pressured falls," 
building under the arch of some tiny niagara; 
the white-tailed ptarmigan "in winter solid white, 
feeding on heather bells and alpine buckwheat"; 
and the eleven eagles of the west, 
"fond of the spring fragrance and the winter colors," 
used to the unegoistic action of the glaciers 
and "several hours of frost every midsummer night." 
"they make a nice appearance, donâ€™t they," 
happy seeing nothing? 
perched on treacherous lava and pumiceâ€” 
those unadjusted chimney-pots and cleavers 
which stipulate "the names and addresses of persons to notify 
in case of disasterâ€”" 
they hear the roar of ice and supervise the water 
winding slowly through the cliffs, 
the road "climbing like the thread 
which forms the groove around a snail-shell, 
doubling back and forth until where snow begins, it ends." 
no "deliberate wide-eyed wistfulness" is here 
among the boulders sunk in ripples and white water 
where "when you hear the best wild music of the mountains it is sure to be a marmot," 
the victim on some slight observatory, 
of "a struggle between curiosity and caution," 
inquiring what has scared it: 
a stone from the moraine descending in leaps, 
another marmot, or the spotted ponies with "glass eyes," 
brought up on frosty grass and flowers 
and rapid draughts of ice water. 
instructed none knows how, to climb the mountain, 
by "business men who as totemic scenery of canada, 
require for recreation, 
three hundred and sixty-five holidays in the year," 
these conspicuously spotted little horses are peculiar; 
hard to discern among the birch trees, ferns, and lily pads, 
avalanche lilies, indian paintbrushes, 
bearsâ€™ ears and kittentails, 
and miniature cavalcades of chlorophylless fungi 
magnified in profile on the moss beds like moonstones in the water; 
the cavalcade of calico competing 
with the original american "menagerie of styles" 
among the white flowers of the rhododendron surmounting rigid leaves 
upon which moisture works its alchemy, 
transmuting verdure into onyx. 
larkspur, blue pincushions, blue peas, and lupin; 
white flowers with white, and red with red; 
the blue ones "growing close together 
so that patches of them look like blue water in the distance": 
this arrangement of colors 
as in persian designs of hard stones with enamel, 
forms a pleasing equationâ€” 
a diamond outside and inside, a white dot; 
on the outside, a ruby; inside, a red dot; 
black spots balanced with black 
in the woodlands where fires have run over the groundâ€” 
separated by aspens, catâ€™s paws, and woolly sunflowers, 
fireweed, asters, and goliath thistles 
"flowering at all altitudes as multiplicitous as barley," 
like pink sapphires in the pavement of the glistening plateau. 
inimical to "bristling, puny, swearing men 
equipped with saws and axes," 
this treacherous glass mountain 
admires gentians, ladyâ€™s slippers, harebells, mountain dryads, 
and "calypso, the goat flowerâ€” 
that greenish orchid fond of snow"â€” 
anomalously nourished upon shelving glacial ledges 
where climbers have not gone or have gone timidly, 
"the one resting his nerves while the other advanced," 
on this volcano with the blue jay, her principal companion. 
"hopping stiffly on sharp feet" like miniature icehacksâ€” 
"secretive, with a look of wisdom and distinction, but a villain, 
fond of human society or the crumbs that go with it," 
he knows no greek, 
"that pride producing language," 
in which "rashness is rendered innocuous, and error exposed 
by the collision of knowledge with knowledge." 
"like happy souls in hell," enjoying mental difficulties, 
the grasshoppers of greece 
amused themselves with delicate behavior 
because it was "so noble and so fair"; 
not practiced in adapting their intelligence 
to eagle traps and snowshoes, 
to alpenstocks and other toys contrived by those 
"alive to the advantage of invigorating pleasures." 
bows, arrows, oars, and paddles for which trees provide the wood, 
in new countries are more eloquent than elsewhereâ€” 
augmenting evidence for the assertion 
that essentially humane, 
"the forest affords wood for dwellings and by its beauty stimulates 
the moral vigor of its citizens." 
the greeks liked smoothness, distrusting what was back 
of what could not be clearly seen, 
resolving with benevolent conclusiveness, 
"complexities which still will be complexities 
as long as the world lasts"; 
ascribing what we clumsily call happiness, 
to "an accident or a quality, 
a spiritual substance or the soul itself, 
an act, a disposition, or a habit, 
or a habit infused to which the soul has been persuaded, 
or something distinct from a habit, a powerâ€”" 
such power as adam had and we are still devoid of. 
"emotionally sensitive, their hearts were hard"; 
their wisdom was remote 
from that of these odd oracles of cool official sarcasm, 
upon this game preserve 
where "guns, nets, seines, traps and explosives, 
hired vehicles, gambling and intoxicants are prohibited, 
disobedient persons being summarily removed 
and not allowed to return without permission in writing." 
it is self evident 
that it is frightful to have everything afraid of one; 
that one must do as one is told 
and eat "rice, prunes, dates, raisins, hardtack, and tomatoes" 
if one would "conquer the main peak" of mount tacoma 
this fossil flower concise without a shiver, 
intact when it is cut, 
damned for its sacrosanct remotenessâ€” 
like henry james "damned by the public for decorum"; 
not decorum, but restraint; 
it was the love of doing hard things 
that rebuffed and wore them outâ€”a public out of sympathy with neatness. 
neatness of finish! neatness of finish! 
relentless accuracy is the nature of this octopus 
with its capacity for fact. 
"creeping slowly as with meditated stealth, 
its arms seeming to approach from all directions," 
it receives one under winds that "tear the snow to bits 
and hurl it like a sandblast, 
shearing off twigs and loose bark from the trees." 
is tree the word for these strange things 
"flat on the ground like vines"; 
some "bent in a half circle with branches on one side 
suggesting dustbrushes, not trees; 
some finding strength in union, forming little stunted groves, 
their flattened mats of branches shrunk in trying to escape" 
from the hard mountain "planed by ice and polished by the wind"â€” 
the white volcano with no weather side; 
the lightning flashing at its base, 
rain falling in the valleys, and snow falling on the peakâ€” 
the glassy octopus symmetrically pointed, 
its claw cut by the avalanche 
"with a sound like the crack of a rifle, 
in a curtain of powdered snow launched like a waterfall. 
sea unicorns and land unicorns 
with their respective lionsâ€” 
"mighty monoceroses with immeasured tayles"â€” 
these are those very animals 
described by the cartographers of 1539, 
defiantly revolving 
in such a way that the hard steel 
in the long keel of white exhibited in tumbling, 
disperses giant weeds 
and those sea snakes whose forms looped in the foam, "disquiet shippers." 
not ignorant of how a voyager obtained the horn of a sea unicorn 
to give queen elizabeth 
who thought it worth a hundred thousand pounds, 
they persevere in swimming where they like, 
finding the place where lions live in herds, 
strewn on the beach like stones with lesser stonesâ€” 
and bears are white; 
discovering antarctica, its penguin kings and icy spires, 
and sir john hawkinsâ€™ florida 
"abounding in land unicorns and lions, 
since where the one is, 
its arch enemy cannot be missing." 
thus personalities by nature much opposed, 
can be combined in such a way 
that when they do agree, their unanimity is great, 
"in politics, in trade, law, sport, religion, 
china collecting, tennis, and church going." 
you have remarked this fourfold combination of strange animals, 
upon embroideries, 
enwrought with "polished garlands" of agreeing indifferenceâ€” 
thorns, "myrtle rods, and shafts of bay," 
"cobwebs, and knotts, and mulberries" 
of lapis lazuli and pomegranate and malachiteâ€” 
britanniaâ€™s sea unicorn with its rebellious child 
now ostentatiously indigenous of the new english coast 
and its land lion oddly tolerant of those pacific counterparts to it, 
the water lions of the west. 
this is a strange fraternityâ€”these sea lions and land lions, 
land unicorns and sea unicorns: 
the lion civilly rampant, 
tame and concessive like the long-tailed bear of ecuadorâ€” 
the lion standing up against this screen of woven air 
which is the forest: 
the unicorn also, on its hind legs in reciprocity. 
a puzzle to the hunters, is this haughtiest of beasts, 
to be distinguished from those born without a horn, 
in use like saint jeromeâ€™s tame lion, as domestics, 
rebelling proudly at the dogs 
which are dismayed by the chain lightning 
playing at them from its hornâ€” 
the dogs persistent in pursuit of it as if it could be caught, 
"deriving agreeable terror" from its "moonbeam throat" 
on fire like its white coat and unconsumed as if of salamanderâ€™s skin. 
so wary as to disappear for centuries and reappear, 
yet never to be caught, 
the unicorn has been preserved 
by an unmatched device 
wrought like the work of expert blacksmiths, 
with which nothing can compareâ€” 
this animal of that one horn 
throwing itself upon which head foremost from a cliff, 
it walks away unharmed, 
proficient in this feat, which like herodotus, 
i have not seen except in pictures. 
thus this strange animal with its miraculous elusiveness, 
has come to be unique, 
"impossible to take alive," 
tamed only by a lady inoffensive like itselfâ€” 
as curiously wild and gentle; 
"as straight and slender as the crest, 
or antlet of the one-beamâ€™d beast." 
upon the printed page, 
also by word of mouth, 
we have a record of it all 
and how, unfearful of deceit, 
etched like an equine monster on an old celestial map, 
beside a cloud or dress of virgin-mary blue, 
improved "all over slightly with snakes of venice gold, 
and silver, and some oâ€™s," 
the unicorn "with pavon high," approaches eagerly; 
until engrossed by what appears of this strange enemy, 
upon the map, "upon her lap," 
its "mild wild head doth lie. 
the steeple-jack 
dã¼rer would have seen a reason for living 
in a town like this, with eight stranded whales 
to look at; with the sweet sea air coming into your house 
on a fine day, from water etched 
with waves as formal as the scales 
on a fish. 
one by one, in twoâ€™s, in threeâ€™s, the seagulls keep 
flying back and forth over the town clock, 
or sailing around the lighthouse without moving the wingsâ€” 
rising steadily with a slight 
quiver of the bodyâ€”or flock 
mewing where 
a sea the purple of the peacockâ€™s neck is 
paled to greenish azure as dã¼rer changed 
the pine green of the tyrol to peacock blue and guinea 
grey. you can see a twenty-five 
pound lobster; and fishnets arranged 
to dry. the 
whirlwind fifeanddrum of the storm bends the salt 
marsh grass, disturbs stars in the sky and the 
star on the steeple; it is a privilege to see so 
much confusion. disguised by what 
might seem austerity, the seaside 
flowers and 
trees are favored by the fog so that you have 
the tropics at first hand: the trumpet-vine, 
fox-glove, giant snap-dragon, a salpiglossis that has 
spots and stripes; morning-glories, gourds, 
or moon-vines trained on fishing-twine 
at the back 
door; cat-tails, flags, blueberries and spiderwort, 
striped grass, lichens, sunflowers, asters, daisiesâ€” 
the yellow and the crab-claw blue ones with green bractsâ€”toad-plant, 
petunias, ferns; pink lilies, blue 
ones, tigers; poppies; black sweet-peas. 
the climate 
is not right for the banyan, frangipani, the 
jack-fruit tree; nor for exotic serpent 
life. ring lizard and snake-skin for the foot if you see fit, 
but here theyâ€™ve cats not cobras to 
keep down the rats. the diffident 
little newt 
with white pin-dots on black horizontal spaced 
out bands lives here; yet there is nothing that 
ambition can buy or take away. the college student 
named ambrose sits on the hill-side 
with his not-native books and hat 
and sees boats 
at sea progress white and rigid as if in 
a groove. liking an elegance of which 
the source is not bravado, he knows by heart the antique 
sugar-bowl shaped summer-house of 
interlacing slats, and the pitch 
of the church 
spire, not true, from which a man in scarlet lets 
down a rope as a spider spins a thread; 
he might be part of a novel, but on the sidewalk a 
sign says c. j. poole, steeple-jack, 
in black and white; and one in red 
and white says 
danger. the church portico has four fluted 
columns, each a single piece of stone, made 
modester by white-wash. this would be a fit haven for 
waifs, children, animals, prisoners, 
and presidents who have repaid 
sin-driven 
senators by not thinking about them. there 
are a school-house, a post-office in a 
store, fish-houses, hen-houses, a three-masted schooner on 
the stocks. the hero, the student, 
the steeple-jack, each in his way, 
is at home. 
it could not be dangerous to be living 
in a town like this, of simple people, 
who have a steeple-jack placing danger signs by the church 
while he is gilding the solidpointed 
star, which on a steeple 
stands for hope. 
the student 
in america everybody must have a degree," the french man 
says, "but the french do not think that all can have it; they donâ€™t 
say everyone must go to college." we 
may feel as he says we do; five kinds of superiority 
might be unattainable by all, but one degree is not too much. 
in each school there is a pair of fruit-trees like that twin tree 
in every other school: tree-of-knowledgeâ€” 
tree-of-lifeâ€”each with a label like that of the other college: 
lux, or lux et veritas, christo et ecclesiae, sapiet 
felici, and if science confers immortality, 
these apple-trees should be for everyone. 
oriental arbor vitae we say lightly. yet you pardon 
it as when one thinking of the navy does not know not to infer 
dishonorable discharge from a d. d. it is a 
thoughtful pupil has two thoughts for the word 
valet; or for bachelor, child, damsel; though no one having heard 
them used as terms of chivalry would make the medieval use of 
them. secluded from domestic strife, jack bookworm led a 
college life says goldsmith. he might not say 
it of the student who shows interest in the strangerâ€™s resumã© 
by asking "when will your experiment be finished, doctor einstein?" 
and is pleased when doctor einstein smiles and says politely 
"science is never finished." but weâ€™re not 
hypocrites, weâ€™re rustics. the football huddle in the vacant lot 
is impersonating calculus and physics and military 
books; and is gathering the data for genetics. if 
scholarship would profit by it, sixteenfoot 
men should be grown; itâ€™s for the football men to say. we must lean 
on their experience. there is vitality in the world of sport. 
if it is not the tree of knowledge, itâ€™s the tree of life. 
when audubon adopted us he taught 
us how to dance. it was the great crab-flounder of montana caught 
and changed from that which creeps to that which is angelic. he taught us how 
to turn as the airport wind-sock turns without an error; 
like alligator, downpour, dynamite, 
and wotan, gliding round the course in a fast neat school, with the white 
of the eye showing; or as sea-lions keep going round and round the 
pool. but there is more to learnâ€”the difference between cow 
and zebu; lion, tiger; barred and brown 
owls; horned owls have one ear that opens up and one that opens down. 
the golden eagle is the one with feathered legs. the penguin wing is 
ancient, not degenerate. swordfish are different from 
gars, if one may speak of gars when the big 
gamehunters are using the fastidious singularâ€”say pig, 
and that they have seen camelsparrow, tigerhorse, rat, mouse, butterfly, 
snake, elephant, fruit-bat, et cetâ€™ra. no fact of scienceâ€” 
theology or biologyâ€”might 
not as well be known; one does not care to hold opinions that fright 
could dislocate. education augments our natural forces and 
prompts us to extend the machinery of advantage 
to those who are without it. one fitted 
to be a scholar must have the heroic mind, emerson said. 
the student concentrates and does not like to fight; "gives his opinion 
firmly and rests on it"â€”in the manner of the poet; 
is reclusive, and reserved; and has such 
ways, not because he has no feeling but because he has so much. 
boasting provokes jibes, and in this country weâ€™ve no cause to boast; we are 
as a nation perhaps, undergraduates not students. 
but anyone who studies will advance. 
are we to grow up or not? they are not all college boys in france. 
no swan so fine 
"no water so still as the 
dead fountains of versailles." no swan, 
with swart blind look askance 
and gondoliering legs, so fine 
as the chintz china one with fawn- 
brown eyes and toothed gold 
collar on to show whose bird it was. 
lodged in the louis fifteenth 
candelabrum-tree of cockscomb- 
tinted buttons, dahlias, 
sea-urchins, and everlastings, 
it perches on the branching foam 
of polished sculptured 
flowersâ€”at ease and tall. the king is dead. 
too much 
a roman hired an 
artist, a freedman, 
to make a coneâ€”pine-cone 
or fir-coneâ€”with holes for a fountain. placed on 
the prison of st. angelo, this cone 
of the pompeys which is known 
now as the popesâ€™, passed 
for art. a huge cast 
bronze, dwarfing the peacock 
statue in the garden of the vatican, 
it looks like a work of art made to give 
to a pompey, or native 
of thebes. others could 
build, and understood 
making colossi and 
how to use slaves, and kept crocodiles and put 
baboons on the necks of giraffes to pick 
fruit, and used serpent magic. 
they had their men tie 
hippopotami 
and bring out dapple dogcats 
to course antelopes, dikdik, and ibex; 
or used small eagles. they looked on as theirs, 
impalas and onagers, 
the wild ostrich herd 
with hard feet and bird 
necks rearing back in the 
dust like a serpent preparing to strike, cranes, 
storks, anoas, mongooses, and nile geese. 
and there were gardens for theseâ€” 
combining planes, dates, 
limes, and pomegranates, 
in avenuesâ€”with square 
pools of pink flowers, tame fish, and small frogs. besides 
yarns dyed with indigo, and red cotton, 
they had a flax which they spun 
into fine linen 
cordage for yachtsmen. 
these people liked small things; 
they gave to boys little paired playthings such as 
nests of eggs, ichneumon and snake, paddle 
and raft, badger and camel; 
and made toys for them- 
selves: the royal totem; 
and toilet-boxes marked 
with the contents. lords and ladies put goose-grease 
paint in round bone boxes with pivoting 
lid incised with the duck-wing 
or reverted duck- 
head; kept in a buck 
or rhinoceros horn, 
the ground horn; and locust oil in stone locusts. 
it was a picture with a fine distance; 
of drought, and of assistance 
in time, from the nile 
rising slowly, while 
the pig-tailed monkey on 
slab-hands, with arched-up slack-slung gait, and the brown 
dandy, looked at the jasmine two-leafed twig 
and bud, cactus-pads, and fig. 
dwarfs here and there, lent 
to an evident 
poetry of frog grays, 
duck-egg greens, and egg-plant blues, a fantasy 
and a verisimilitude that were 
right to those with, everywhere, 
power over the poor. 
the beesâ€™ food is your 
food. those who tended flowerbeds 
and stables were like the kingâ€™s cane in the 
form of a hand, or the folding bedroom 
made for his mother of whom 
he was fond. princes 
clad in queensâ€™ dresses 
calla or petunia 
white that trembled at the edge, and queens in a 
kingâ€™s underskirt of fine-twilled thread like silk- 
worm gut, as bee-man and milk- 
maid, kept divine cows 
and bees; limestone brows, 
and gold-foil wings. they made 
basalt serpents and portraits of beetles; the 
king gave his name to them and he was named 
for them. he feared snakes and tamed 
pharaohâ€™s rat, the rust- 
backed mongoose. no bust 
of it was made, but there 
was pleasure for the rat. its restlessness was 
its excellence; it was praised for its wit; 
and the jerboa, like it, 
a small desert rat, 
and not famous, that 
lives without water, has 
happiness. abroad seeking food, or at home 
in its burrow, the sahara field-mouse 
has a shining silver house 
of sand. o rest and 
joy, the boundless sand, 
the stupendous sand-spout, 
no water, no palm-trees, no ivory bed, 
tiny cactus; but one would not be he 
who has nothing but plenty. 
in costa rica 
in blazing driftwood 
the green keeps showing at the same place; 
as, intermittently, the fire-opal shows blue and green. 
in costa rica the true chinese lizard face 
is found, of the amphibious falling dragon, the living firework. 
he leaps and meets his 
likeness in the stream and, king with king, 
helped by his three-part plume along the back, runs on two legs, 
tail dragging; faints upon the air; then with a spring 
dives to the stream-bed, hiding as the chieftain with gold body hid in 
guatavita lake. 
he runs, he flies, he swims, to get to 
his basilicaâ€”"the ruler of rivers, lakes, and seas, 
invisible or visible," with clouds to do 
as bidâ€”and can be "long or short, and also coarse or fine at pleasure." with a 
modest quiver, he 
ascends the bank on clinging tree-frog 
hands, and waits; the water draining, forms a lizard there, from 
skin now looking a little newer than the log 
it rested on & the thick mass of verdure all about. this is the 
feather basilisk 
of travelersâ€™ tales, of which a pair stood 
bodyguard beside confuciusâ€™ crib: aquatic flying 
lizard-fairy detested by such dragonhood 
as michael fought. one has seen animals like his, though smaller, collide 
and fight, brother matched 
with brother, as if immune to pain; 
push, struggle and breathe hard; swell out and muster strength, withdraw, 
advance; and swerving, almost fallâ€”hoping to gain 
the mortal hold and that some fang should pierce the marrow. but when plumet 
territories touch, 
the masters of them are dramatic 
without shedding blood, exerting charm as chinese dragonwhiskers 
in a crystal handle charm; or as thickflowering 
orchids gather dragons, in the east, by forming clouds for them. 
the malay dragon 
we have ours; and they 
have theirs. ours has a skin feather crest; 
theirs has wings out from the waist which is snuff-brown or sallow. 
ours falls from trees on water; theirs is the smallest 
dragon that knows how to dive head-first from a tree-top to something dry. 
floating on spread ribs, 
the boat-like body settles on the 
clamshell-tinted spray sprung from the nutmeg-treeâ€”minute legs 
trailing half akimboâ€”the true divinity 
of malay. among unfragrant orchids, on the unnutritious nut 
tree, myristica 
fragrans, the harmless god spreads ribs that 
do not raise a hood. this is the serpent-dove peculiar 
to the east; that lives as the butterfly or bat 
can, in a brood, conferring wings on what it grasps, as the air-plant does. 
the tuatera 
elsewhere, sea lizardsâ€” 
congregated so there is not room 
to step, with tails laid criss-cross, alligator-style, among 
birds toddling in and outâ€”are innocent of whom 
they neighbor. bird-reptile social life is pleasing. the tuatera 
will tolerate a 
petrel in its den, and lays ten eggs 
or nineâ€”the number laid by dragons since "a true dragon 
has nine sons." the frilled lizard, the kind with no legs, 
and the three-horned chameleon, are non-serious ones that take to flight 
if you do not. in 
copenhagen the principal door 
of the bourse is roofed by two pairs of dragons standing on 
their headsâ€”twirled by the architectâ€”so that the four 
green tails conspiring upright, symbolize four-fold security. now, 
the frigate pelican 
rapidly cruising or lying on the air there is a bird 
that realizes rasselasâ€™s friendâ€™s project 
of wings uniting levity with strength. this 
hell-diver, frigate-bird, hurricane- 
bird; unless swift is the proper word 
for him, the storm omen when 
he flies close to the waves, should be seen 
fishing, although oftener 
he appears to prefer 
to take, on the wing, from industrious cruder-winged species 
the fish they have caught, and is seldom successless. 
a marvel of grace, no matter how fast his 
victim may fly or how often may 
turn, the dishonest pelicanâ€™s ease 
in pursuit, bears him away 
with the fish that the badgered bird drops. 
a kind of superlative 
swallow, that likes to live 
on food caught while flying, he is not a pelican. the toe 
with slight web, air-boned body, and very long wings 
with the spread of a swanâ€™sâ€”duplicating a 
bow-string as he floats overheadâ€”feel 
the changing v-shaped scissor swallow- 
tail direct the rigid keel. 
and steering beak to windward always, 
the fleetest foremost fairy 
among birds, outflies the 
aeroplane which cannot flap its wings nor alter any quill- 
tip. for him, the feeling in a hand, in fins, is 
in his unbent downbent crafty oar. with him 
other pelicans aimlessly soar 
as he does; separating, until 
not flapping they rise once more, 
closing in without looking and move 
outward again to the top 
of the circle and stop 
and blow back, allowing the wind to reverse their direction. 
this is not the stalwart swan that can ferry the 
woodcutterâ€™s two children home; no. make hay; keep 
the shop; i have one sheep; were a less 
limber animalâ€™s mottoes. this one 
finds sticks for the swanâ€™s-down dress 
of his child to rest upon and would 
not know gretel from hã¤nsel. 
as impassioned handelâ€” 
meant for a lawyer and a masculine german domestic 
careerâ€”clandestinely studied the harpsichord 
and never was known to have fallen in love, 
the unconfiding frigate-bird hides 
in the height and in the majestic 
display of his art. he glides 
a hundred feet or quivers about 
as charred paper behavesâ€”full 
of feints; and an eagle 
of vigilance, earns the term aquiline; keeping at a height 
so great the feathers look black and the beak does not 
show. it is not retreat but exclusion from 
which he looks down and observes what went 
secretly, as it thought, out of sight 
among dense jungle plants. sent 
ahead of the rest, there goes the true 
knight in his jointed coat that 
covers all but his bat 
ears; a-trot, with stiff pig gaitâ€”our tame armadillo, loosed by 
his master and as pleased as a dog. beside the 
spattered bloodâ€”that orchid which the native fearsâ€” 
the fer-de-lance lies sleeping; centaur- 
like, this harmful coupleâ€™s amity 
is apropos. a jaguar 
and crocodile are fighting. sharp-shinned 
hawks and peacock-freckled small 
cats, like the literal 
merry-go-round, come wandering within the circular view 
of the high bird for whom from the air they are ants 
keeping house all their lives in the crack of a 
crag with no view from the top. and here, 
unlikely animals learning to 
dance, crouch on two steeds that rear 
behind a leopard with a frantic 
face, tamed by an artemis 
who wears a dress like his, 
and hampering haymakerâ€™s hat. festina lente. be gay 
civilly. how so? "if i do well i am blessed 
whether any bless me or not, and if i do 
ill i am cursed." we watch the moon rise 
on the susquehanna. in his way 
this most romantic bird, flies 
to a more mundane place, the mangrove 
swamp, to sleep. he wastes the moon. 
but he, and others, soon 
rise from the bough, and though flying are able to foil the tired 
moment of danger, that lays on heart and lungs the 
weight of the python that crushes to powder. 
the tuneâ€™s illiterate footsteps fail; 
the steam hacks are not to be admired. 
these, unturbulent, avail 
themselves of turbulence to flyâ€”pleased 
with the faint windâ€™s varyings, 
on which to spread fixed wings. 
the reticent lugubrious ragged immense minuet 
descending to leeward, ascending to windward 
again without flapping, in what seems to be 
a way of resting, are now nearer, 
but as seemingly bodiless yet 
as they were. theirs are somber 
quills for so wide and lightboned a bird 
as the frigate pelican 
of the caribbean. 
the buffalo 
black in blazonry means 
prudence; and niger, unpropitious. might 
hematite- 
black incurved compact horns on a bison 
have significance? the 
soot brown tail-tuft on 
a kind of lion- 
tail; what would that express? 
and john steuart curryâ€™s ajax pulling 
grassâ€”no ring 
in his noseâ€”two birds standing on his back? 
though prints like this cannot 
show if they were black 
birds, nor the color 
of the back. the modern 
ox does not look like the augsburg oxâ€™s 
portrait. yes, 
the great extinct wild aurochs was a beast 
to paint, with stripe and sixfoot 
horn-spreadâ€”decreased 
to siamese-cat- 
brown swiss size, or zebu 
shape with white plush dewlap and warm-blooded 
hump; to red- 
skinned hereford or to piebald holstein. yet 
some would say the sparse-haired 
buffalo has met 
human notions bestâ€” 
unlike the elephant, 
both jewel and jeweler in the hairs 
that he wearsâ€” 
no white-nosed vermont ox yoked with its twin 
to haul the maple sap, 
up to their knees in 
snow; no freakishly 
over-drove ox drawn by 
rowlandson, but the indian buffalo, 
albino- 
footed, standing in the mud-lake, with a 
dayâ€™s work to do. no white 
christian heathen, waylaid 
by the buddha, 
serves him so well as the 
buffaloâ€”as mettlesome as if check- 
reinedâ€”free neck 
stretching out, and snake-tail in a half twist 
on the flank; nor will so 
cheerfully assist 
the sage sitting with 
feet at the same side, to 
dismount at the shrine; nor are there any 
ivory 
tusks like those two horns which when a tiger 
coughs, are lowered fiercely 
and convert the fur 
to harmless rubbish. 
the indian buffalo, 
led by bare-leggã¨d herd-boys to a hay 
hut where they 
stable it, need not fear comparison 
with bison, with the twins, 
nor with anyone 
of ox ancestry. 
nine nectarines and other porcelain 
arranged by twoâ€™s as peaches are, 
at intervals that all may liveâ€” 
eight and a single one, on twigs that 
grew the year beforeâ€”they look like 
a derivative; 
although not uncommonly 
the opposite is seenâ€” 
nine peaches on a nectarine. 
fuzzless through slender crescent leaves 
of green or blueâ€”or both, 
in the chinese styleâ€”the four 
pairsâ€™ half-moon leaf-mosaic turns 
out to the sun the sprinkled blush 
of puce-american-beauty pink 
applied to beeswax gray by the 
unenquiring brush 
of mercantile bookbinding. 
like the peach yu, the red- 
cheeked peach which cannot aid the dead, 
but eaten in time prevents death, 
the italian peachnut, 
persian plum, ispahan 
secluded wall-grown nectarine, 
as wild spontaneous fruit was 
found in china first. but was it wild? 
prudent de candolle would not say. 
we cannot find flaws 
in this emblematic group 
of nine, with leaf window 
unquilted by curculioâ€” 
which someone once depicted on 
this much-mended plate; or 
in the also accurate 
unantlered moose, or iceland horse, 
or ass, asleep against the old 
thick, low-leaning nectarine that is the 
color of the shrub-treeâ€™s brownish 
flower. from manifold 
small boughs, productive as the 
magic willow that grew 
above the motherâ€™s grave and threw 
on cinderella what she wished, 
a bat is winging. it 
is a moonlight scene, bringing 
the animal so near, its eyes 
are separate from the faceâ€”mere 
delicately drawn gray discs, out from 
itself in space. imperial 
happiness lives here 
on the peaches of long life 
that make it permanent. 
a fungus could have meant 
long life; a crane, a stork, a dove. 
china, with flowers and birds 
and half-beasts, became the land 
of the best china-making first. 
hunts and domestic scenes occur 
in france on dinner-plates, signed on the 
back with a two-finned fish; england 
has an officer 
in jack-boots seated in a 
bosquet, the cow, the flock 
of sheep, the pheasant, the peacock 
sweeping near with lifted claw; the 
skilled peonian rose 
and the rosebud that began 
with william billingsley (once poor, 
like a monkey on a dolphin, tossed 
by ocean, mighty monster) until 
josiah spode adopted him. 
yet with the gold-glossed 
serpent handles, are there green 
cocks with "brown beaks and cheeks 
and dark blue combs" and mammal freaks 
that, like the chinese certainties 
and sets of precious things, 
dare to be conspicuous? 
theirs is a race that "understands 
the spirit of the wilderness" 
and the nectarine-loving kylin 
of pony appearanceâ€”the long- 
tailed or the tailless 
small cinnamon-brown common 
camel-haired unicorn 
with antelope feet and no horn, 
here enamelled on porcelain. 
it was a chinese who 
imagined this masterpiece. 
pigeons 
older than the ancient greeks, than 
solomon, the pigeon family is a 
ramifying one, a 
banyan of banyans; to begin 
with, bluish slate, 
but with ability. modesty cannot dull 
the lustre of the pigeon 
swift and sure, coming quickest and 
straightest just after a storm. the great 
lame war hero cher ami, the 
lost battalionâ€™s gallant bird; and 
mocker with one eye 
destroyed, delivering his dispatch 
to his superiors; and sergeant dunn, 
civilian pigeon who flew eight 
hundred sixty-eight miles 
in four days and six hours; 
and destined to hatch 
in france, spike, veteran of 
the division in which mocker 
servedâ€”exceptional messenger. 
"rarely was confidence misplaced" a newspaper 
says. dastardly comment 
inexactly phrased, as used of her- 
mes, ariel, or leanderâ€” 
pigeons of the past. neither was confidence 
misplaced in the javan- 
sumatran birds the dutch had had 
brought from baghdad. 
mysterious animal with a magnetic 
feel by which he traces backward 
his transportation outward, 
even in a fog at sea, though glad 
to be tossed near enough the loft 
or coop to get back the same day. 
"home on time without 
his message." what matter since he has 
got back. migrating always in the same 
direction, bringing all letters 
to the same address, see- 
ing better homes than his, 
he is not theudas 
boasting himself to be some- 
body, this anonymous post- 
man who, as soon as he could fly, 
was carrying valentines and messages of 
state; or soberer newsâ€” 
"so please write me and believe that i 
am yours very truly"; fine words 
those. an instrument not just an instinctive 
individual, this 
dove, that lifts his right foot over 
the alighting- 
board to rejoin his ungainly pin-clad dark-skinned 
brood as domestic turtle- 
doves might; two. invariably 
two. the turtle, a not exciting 
birdâ€”in britain shy, detected 
by its constantly heard coo, with- 
out a song but not 
without a voiceâ€”does well to stay far 
out of sight; but the pelew pigeon with 
black head, metallic wasp-lustred 
grass-green breast and purple 
legs and feet, need not; nor 
need the nicobar, 
novel, narrow-feathered dove. 
and one should see the papuan 
fancrests with six-sided scale which 
coats the foot; "not much is known about these splendid 
birds" hid in unimag- 
inably weak lead-colored ostrich- 
plumes a third of an inch long, and 
needle-fine cat-whisker-fibered battleship- 
gray lace. the samoan 
tooth-billed pigeon fortunately 
survives alsoâ€” 
saved from destruction by no longer feeding on 
the ground, a bird with short legs 
and heavy bill, remarkable 
because related to the dodo. 
didus ineptus; manâ€™s remorse 
enshrines it now, abundant still 
in sixteen-one. "a 
little bigger than our swans, these birds 
want wings and lay but one egg" the traveler 
saidâ€”"defenceless unsuspicious 
things, with a cry like the 
cry of a gosling." il

mean simple one)â€”extinct as 
the solitaires which having "raised 
their young one do not disunite." 
a new pigeon cannot compensate, but we have 
it. with neat-cered eye, long 
face, trim form and posture, this delight- 
ful bird outdoes the dashingly 
black and white dalmatian dog and map-freckled 
pony that indians dress 
with feathers seriatim down 
the mane and tail;â€” 
a slender cinderella deliberately

punishing debtors, seeking his dueâ€”as

no chance of peace.

alive. the root-handled cudgel

the three legs of the triskelion 
meeting in the 
middle between triangles, run 
in unison

ful, plodding, to-

that stark sincere unflattery, 
sine cera, is both farthest 
from self-defensiveness and nearest; 
as when a seal 
without haste, slowly is impressed 
and forms a nest 
on which the raised device reversed,

studious and self-possessed,

something which will partially

the three similar, meek- 
coated birdâ€™s-eye

from the beak 
of one, the still living 
beetle has dropped 
out, she picks it up and puts 
it in again. 
standing in the shade till they have dressed 
their thickly-filamented, pale 
pussy-willow-surfaced 
coats, they spread tail 
and wings, showing one by one, 
the modest 
white stripe lengthwise on the 
tail and crosswise 
on the under wing, and the 
accordion 
is closed again. what delightful note 
with rapid unexpected flute- 
sounds leaping from the throat 
of the astute 
grown bird comes back to one from 
the remote 
unenergetic sun- 
lit air before 
the brood was here? why has the 
birdâ€™s voice become 
harsh? a piebald cat observing them, 
is slowly creeping toward the trim 
trio on the tree-stem. 
unused to him 
the three make roomâ€”uneasy 
new problem. 
a dangling foot that missed 
its grasp, is raised 
and finds the twig on which it 
planned to perch. the

half deity 
half worm. we all, infant and adult, have 
stopped to watch the butterflyâ€”last of the 
elvesâ€”and learned to spare the wingless worm 
that hopefully ascends the tree. the well-known 
silk tiger swallowtail 
of south america, with body lightly 
furred was that bearing pigments which engrave 
the lower wings with dragonâ€™s blood, weightless. 
they that have wings must not have weights. this more 
peninsula-tailed one with a black 
pitchfork-scallop edge on sunburnt zebra-skin, 
tired by the trip it made 
with drover-like tenacity, has been 
sleeping upright on the elm. its yellowness, 
that of the autumn poplar-leaf, by day 
has been observed. disguised in butterfly- 
bush wedgwood-blue, psyche follows it 
to that small tree, micromalus, the midget 
crab; to the mimosa; 
and from that, to the flowering pomegranate. 
baffled not by the quick-clouding serene gray 
moon but forced by the hot hot sun to pant, 
she stands on rug-soft grass; though "it is not 
permitted to gaze informally 
on majesty in such a manner as might 
well happen here." the blind 
all-seeing butterfly, fearing the slight 
finger, wanders, as though it were ignorant, 
across the path and lights on zephyrâ€™s palm, 
planting forefeet soberly; then pawing 
like a horse, turns roundâ€”apostrophe- 
tipped brown antennae: porcupining out as 
it arranges nervous 
wings. vexed because curiosity has 
been pursuing it, it cannot now be calm. 
the butterflyâ€™s round unglazed china eyes, 
pale tobacco brown, with the large eyes of 
the nymph on themâ€”gray eyes that now are 
black, for she with controlled agitated glance 
observes the insectâ€™s face 
and allâ€™s a-quiver with significanceâ€” 
enact the scene of catsâ€™ eyes on the magpieâ€™s 
eyes, by goya. butterflies do not need 
home advice. as though zephyr and psyche 
were patent-leather cricket singing 
loud, and gnat-catching garden-toad, the swallow-

ous, springs away, zebra half-deified, 
trampling the air as it tramples the flowers, feed- 
ing where it pivots. twig-veined irascible 
fastidious stubborn undisciplined 
zebra! sometimes one is grateful to 
a stranger for looking very nice. but free 
to leave the outspread hand 
it flies, drunken with triviality 
or guided by visions of strength, off until, 
diminishing like wreckage on the sea, 
rising and falling easily, it mounts 
the swell and keeping its true course with 
what swift majesty, indifferent to 
us, is gone. deaf to ap- 
provalâ€”magnet-nice, as it flutters through 
airs now slack, now fresh. it has strict ears when the 
west wind speaks. it was he, with mirror eyes 
of strong anxiety, who had no net 
or flowering shrewd-scented tropical 
device, or lignum vitae perch in half-shut 
hand; for ours is not a 
canely land; nor was it oberon, but 
this quiet young man with piano replies, 
named zephyr, whose hand spread out was enough 
to tempt the fiery tiger-horse to stand, 
eyes staring skyward and chest arching 
bravely outâ€”historic metamorphoser 
and saintly animal 
in india, in egypt, anywhere. 
his talk was as strange as my grandmotherâ€™s muff. 
smooth gnarled crape myrtle 
a brass-green bird with grass- 
green throat smooth as a nut, springs from 
twig to twig askew, copying the 
chinese flower pieceâ€”businesslike atom 
in the stiff-leafed treeâ€™s blue- 
pink, dregs-of-wine, pyramids 
of mathematic 
circularityâ€”one of a 
pair. a redbird with a hatchet 
crest lights straight, on a twig 
between the two, bending the 
peculiar 
bouquet down; and there are 
several black antique 
bootjack fireflies touched with weak bright 
hunting-pink. "the legendary white- 
eared black bulbul that sings 
only in pure sanskrit" should 
be hereâ€”"tame clever 
true nightingale." the cardinal- 
bird that is usually a 
pair looks somewhat odd, like 
"the ambassadorial 
inverness 
worn by one who dresses 
in new york but dreams of 
london." it was artifice saw 
on a patch-box pigeon-egg, room for 
fervent script, and wrote as with a birdâ€™s claw 
under the pair on the 
hyacinth-blue lidâ€”"joined in 
friendship, crowned by love." 
an aspect may deceive; as the 
elephantâ€™s columbine-tubed trunk 
held waveringly outâ€” 
an at will heavy thingâ€”is 
delicate. 
art is unfortunate. 
one may be a blameless 
bachelor and it is but a 
step to congreve. a rosalindless 
redbird comes where people are, knowing they 
have not made a point of 
being where he isâ€”this bird 
which says not sings, "without 
loneliness i should be more 
lonely, so i keep it"â€”half in 
japanese. and what of 
our clasped hands that swear "by peace 
plenty; as 
by wisdom peace." alas!

indubitable son? im- 
pressive animal

armor seems extra. but for him, 
the closing ear- 
ridgeâ€”or bare 
ear, lacking even this small 
eminenceâ€”and similarly safe 
contracting nose and eye apertures 
impenetrably closable, 
are not;â€”a true ant-eat-

exhausting solitary 
trips through unfamiliar ground at night, 
returning before sunrise; stepping 
in the moonlight,    on the moonlight 
peculiarly, that the out- 
side edges of his 
hands may bear the weight and save the claws 
for digging. serpentined about 
the tree, he draws 
away from 
danger unpugnaciously, 
with no sound but a harmless hiss; keep- 
ing the fragile grace of the thomas- 
of-leighton-buzzard westminster 
abbey wrought-iron vine, or 
rolls himself into a ball that has 
power to defy all effort 
to unroll it;â€”strongly intailed, neat 
head for core, on neck not breaking off, 
with curled-in feet. nevertheless 
he has sting-proof scales; and nest 
of rocks closed with earth 
from inside, which he can thus darken.

quivering violently when it 
retaliates    and swarms on him. 
compact like the furled fringed frill 
on the hat-brim of 
gargalloâ€™s hollow iron head of a 
matador, he will drop and will 
then walk away 
unhurt, al- 
though if unintruded on 
he will come slowly down the tree, helped 
by his tail. the giant-pangolin 
tail, graceful tool, as prop or hand 
or broom or axe, tipped like 
the elephantâ€™s trunk with special skin, 
is not lost on this ant and 
stone swallowing uninjurable 
artichoke, which simpletons thought a 
living fable    whom the stones had 
nourished whereas ants had done 
so. pangolins are 
not aggressive animals; between 
dusk and day, they have the not un- 
chainlike, machine- 
like form and 
frictionless creep of a thing 
made graceful by adversities, con- 
versities. to explain grace requires 
a curious hand. if that which 
is at all were not for 
ever, why would those who graced the spires 
with animals and gathered 
there to rest, on cold luxurious 
low stone seatsâ€”a monk and monk and monkâ€” 
between the thus ingenious roof- 
supports, have slaved to confuse 
grace with a kindly 
manner, time in which to pay a debt, 
the cure for sins, a graceful use 
of what are yet 
approved stone 
mullions branching out across 
the perpendiculars? a sailboat 
was the first machine. the manis, made 
for moving quietly also, 
is neither a prisoner 
nor a god; on hind feet plantigrade, 
with certain postures of a 
man. beneath sun and moon, man slaving 
to make his life more sweet, leaves half the 
flowers worth having,    needing to choose 
wisely how to use the strength;â€” 
a paper-maker 
like the wasp; a tractor of food-stuffs, 
like the ant; spidering a length 
of web from bluffs 
above a 
stream; in fighting, mechanicked 
like the pangolin; capsizing in 
disheartenment. bedizened or stark 
naked, man, the self, the being 
so-called human, writingmaster 
to this world, griffons a dark 
"like does not like like that is 
obnoxious"; and writes errror with four 
râ€™s. among animals, one has a 
sense of humor    then, which saves a 
few steps, which saves yearsâ€”unig- 
norant, modest and 
unemotional, and all emo- 
tion; one with everlasting vig- 
or, power to grow 
though there are 
few of himâ€”who can make one 
breathe faster, and make one erecter. 
not afraid of anything is he 
and then goes cowering forth, tread paced 
to meet an obstacle 
at every step. consistent with the 
formulaâ€”warm blood, no gills, 
two pairs of hands and a few hairsâ€”that 
is a mammal; there he sits in his 
own habitat,    serge-clad, strong-shod. 
the prey of fear; he, always 
curtailed, extinguished, 
thwarted by the dusk, work partly done, 
says to the alternating blaze, 
"again the sun! 
anew each 
day; and new and new and new, 
that comes into and steadies my soul. 
rigorists 
"we saw reindeer 
browsing," a friend whoâ€™d been in lapland, said: 
"finding their own food; they are adapted 
to scant reino 
or pasture, yet they can run eleven 
miles in fifty minutes; the feet spread when 
the snow is soft, 
and act as snow-shoes. they are rigorists 
however handsomely cutwork artists 
of lapland and 
siberia elaborate the trace 
or saddle-girth with saw-tooth leather lace. 
one looked at us 
with its firm face part brown, part white,â€”a queen 
of alpine flowers. santa clausâ€™ reindeer, seen 
at last, had gray- 
brown fur, with a neck like edelweiss or 
lionâ€™s foot,â€”leontopodium more 
exactly." and 
this candelabrum-headed ornament 
for a place where ornaments are scarce, sent 
to alaska, 
was a gift preventing the extinction 
of the esquimo. the battle was won 
by a quiet man, 
sheldon jackson, evangel to that race 
whose reprieve he read in the reindeerâ€™s face. 
four quartz crystal clocks 
there are four vibrators, the worldâ€™s exactest clocks; 
and these quartz time-pieces that tell 
time intervals to other clocks, 
these worksless clocks work well; 
and all four, independently the 
same, are there in the cool bell 
laboratory time 
vault. checked by a comparator with arlington, 
they punctualize the "radio, 
cinã©ma," and "presse,"â€”a group the 
giraudoux truth-bureau 
of hoped-for accuracy has termed 
"instruments of truth." we knowâ€” 
as jean giraudoux says 
certain arabs have not heardâ€”that napoleon 
is dead; that a quartz prism when 
the temperature changes, feels 
the change and that the then 
electrified alternate edges 
oppositely charged, threaten 
careful timing; so that 
this water-clear crystal as the greeks used to say, 
this "clear ice" must be kept at the 
same coolness. repetition, with 
the scientist, should be 
synonymous with accuracy. 
the lemur-student can see 
that an aye-aye is not 
an angwan-tã­bo, potto, or loris. the sea- 
side burden should not embarrass 
the bell-boy with the buoy-ball 
endeavoring to pass 
hotel patronesses; nor could a 
practiced ear confuse the glass 
eyes for taxidermists 
with eye-glasses from the optometrist. and as 
meridian-7 1, 2 
1, 2 gives, each fifteenth second 
in the same voice, the new 
dataâ€”"the time will be" so and soâ€” 
you realize that "when you 
hear the signal," youâ€™ll be 
hearing jupiter or jour pater, the day godâ€” 
the salvaged son of father timeâ€” 
telling the cannibal chronos 
(eater of his proxime 
newborn progeny) that punctuality 
is not a crime. 
the paper nautilus 
for authorities whose hopes 
are shaped by mercenaries? 
writers entrapped by 
teatime fame and by 
commutersâ€™ comforts? not for these 
the paper nautilus 
constructs her thin glass shell. 
giving her perishable 
souvenir of hope, a dull 
white outside and smooth- 
edged inner surface 
glossy as the sea, the watchful 
maker of it guards it 
day and night; she scarcely 
eats until the eggs are hatched. 
buried eight-fold in her eight 
arms, for she is in 
a sense a devil- 
fish, her glass ramshorn-cradled freight 
is hid but is not crushed. 
as hercules, bitten 
by a crab loyal to the hydra, 
was hindered to succeed, 
the intensively 
watched eggs coming from 
the shell free it when they are freed,â€” 
leaving its wasp-nest flaws 
of white on white, and close- 
laid ionic chiton-folds 
like the lines in the mane of 
a parthenon horse, 
round which the arms had 
wound themselves as if they knew love 
is the only fortress 
strong enough to trust to. 
nevertheless 
youâ€™ve seen a strawberry 
thatâ€™s had a struggle; yet 
was, where the fragments met, 
a hedgehog or a starfish 
for the multitude 
of seeds. what better food 
than apple-seedsâ€”the fruit 
within the fruitâ€”locked in 
like counter-curved twin 
hazel-nuts? frost that kills 
the little rubber-plant- 
leaves of kok-saghyz-stalks, canâ€™t 
harm the roots; they still grow 
in frozen ground. once where 
there was a prickly-pear- 
leaf clinging to barbed wire, 
a root shot down to grow 
in earth two feet below; 
as carrots form mandrakes 
or a ramâ€™s-horn root some- 
times. victory wonâ€™t come 
to me unless i go 
to it; a grape-tendril 
ties a knot in knots till 
knotted thirty times,â€”so 
the bound twig thatâ€™s under- 
gone and over-gone, canâ€™t stir. 
the weak overcomes its 
menace, the strong over- 
comes itself. what is there 
like fortitude! what sap 
went through that little thread 
to make the cherry red! 
the wood-weasel 
emerges daintily, the skunkâ€” 
donâ€™t laughâ€”in sylvan black and white chipmunk 
regalia. the inky thing 
adaptively whited with glistening 
goat-fur, is wood-warden. in his 
ermined well-cuttlefish-inked wool, he is 
determinationâ€™s totem. outlawed? 
his sweet face and powerful feet go about 
in chieftainâ€™s coat of chilcat cloth. 
he is his own protection from the moth, 
noble little warrior. that 
otter-skin on it, the living pole-cat, 
smothers anything that stings. well,â€” 
this same weaselâ€™s playful and his weasel 
associates are too. only 
wood-weasels shall associate with me. 
elephants 
uplifted and waved until immobilized 
wistarialike, the opposing opposed 
mouse-gray twined proboscisesâ€™ trunk formed by two 
trunks, fights itself to a spiraled inter-nosed 
deadlock of dyke-enforced massiveness. itâ€™s a 
knock-down drag-out fight that asks no quarter? just 
a pastime, as when the trunk rains on itself 
the pool it siphoned up; or whenâ€”since each must 
provide his forty-pound bough dinnerâ€”he broke 
the leafy branches. these templars of the tooth, 
these matched intensities, take master care of 
master tools. one, sleeping with the calm of youth, 
at full length in the half dry sun-flecked stream-bed, 
rests his hunting-horn-curled trunk on shallowed stone. 
the sloping hollow of the sleeperâ€™s body 
cradles the gently breathing eminenceâ€™s prone 
mahout, asleep like a lifeless six-foot 
frog, so feather light the elephantâ€™s stiff 
earâ€™s unconscious of the crossed feetâ€™s weight. and the 
defenseless human thing sleeps as sound as if 
incised with hard wrinkles, embossed with wide ears, 
invincibly tusked, made safe by magic hairs! 
as if, as if, it is all ifs; we are at 
much unease. but magicâ€™s masterpiece is theirs,â€” 
houdiniâ€™s serenity quelling his fears. 
elephant ear-witnesses-to-be of hymns 
and glorias, these ministrants all gray or 
gray with white on legs or trunk, are a pilgrimsâ€™ 
pattern of revery not reverence,â€”a 
religious procession without any priests, 
the centuries-old carefullest unrehearsed 
play. blessed by buddhaâ€™s tooth, the obedient beasts 
themselves as toothed temples blessing the street, see 
the white elephant carry the cushion that 
carries the casket that carries the tooth. 
amenable to what, matched with him, are gnat 
trustees, he does not step on them as the white- 
canopied blue-cushioned tooth is augustly 
and slowly returned to the shrine. though white is 
the color of worship and of mourning, he 
is not here to worship and he is too wise 
to mourn,â€”a life-prisoner but reconciled. 
with trunk tucked up compactlyâ€”the elephantâ€™s 
sign of defeatâ€”he resisted, but is the child 
of reason now. his straight trunk seems to say: when 
what we hoped for came to nothing, we revived. 
as loss could not ever alter socratesâ€™ 
tranquillity, the elephant has contrived 
equanimity. with the socrates of 
animals as with sophocles the bee, on whose 
tombstone a hive was incised, sweetness tinctures 
his gravity. his held up fore-leg for use 
as a stair, to be climbed or descended with 
the aid of his ear, expounds the brotherhood 
of creatures to man the encroacher by the 
small word with the dot, meaning know,â€”the verb bd. 
these knowers, these distinct rememberers 
like buë™ d, of what they have experienced, are 
"unable to pierce by one dart from the bow 
four plaintain-leaves laid at the points of a square"; 
and cannot, like buddha, change missiles to wreaths, 
alter their shape, bisect hairs in the dark, make 
their wisdom apparent in rays of all hues, 
or turn heat, exasperated, to earthquake- 
fire. yet they "arouse the feeling that they are 
allied to man" and can change roles with their trustees. 
hardship makes the soldier; then teachableness 
makes him the philosopherâ€”as socrates, 
prudently testing the suspicious thing, knew 
the wisest is he whoâ€™s not sure that he knows. 
who rides on a tiger can never dismount; 
asleep on an elephant, that is repose. 
the mind is an enchanting thing 
is an enchanted thing 
like the glaze on a 
katydid-wing 
subdivided by sun 
till the nettings are legion. 
like gieseking playing scarlatti; 
like the apteryx-awl 
as a beak, or the 
kiwiâ€™s rain-shawl 
of haired feathers, the mind 
feeling its way as though blind, 
walks along with its eyes on the ground. 
it has memoryâ€™s ear 
that can hear without 
having to hear. 
like the gyroscopeâ€™s fall, 
truly unequivocal 
because trued by regnant certainty, 
it is a power of 
strong enchantment. it 
is like the dove- 
neck animated by 
sun; it is memoryâ€™s eye; 
itâ€™s conscientious inconsistency. 
it tears off the veil; tears 
the temptation, the 
mist the heart wears, 
from its eyes,â€”if the heart 
has a face; it takes apart 
dejection. itâ€™s fire in the dove-neckâ€™s 
iridescence; in the 
inconsistencies 
of scarlatti. 
unconfusion submits 
its confusion to proof; itâ€™s 
not a herodâ€™s oath that cannot change. 
keeping their world large 
all too literally, their flesh 
and their spirit are our shield
