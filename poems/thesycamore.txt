against a gun-metal sky 
i saw an albino giraffe. without 
leaves to modify, 
chamois-white as 
said, though partly pied near the base, 
it towered where a chain of 
stepping-stones lay in a stream nearby; 
glamour to stir the envy 
of anything in motley— 
hampshire pig, the living lucky-stone; or 
all-white butterfly. 
a commonplace: 
there’s more than just one kind of grace. 
we don’t like flowers that do 
not wilt; they must die, and nine 
she-camel-hairs aid memory.
