i checked my email, resenting its incursion into 
the blue morning. 
my husband was culling books. i thought we should keep 
a naturalist's guide to ontario. (oh, 
all the things we thought we'd get to, rocks, 
bogs and fields, 
the shaping of moraines.) the garbage truck 
came by, opened capacious metal arms 
to hoist the bin, then set it down. i sorted 
sections of the star and villager, refrained 
from clipping recipes, remembering 
anne's advice: only 
if you'll make the avocado soup that day. i peeled 
a clementine, 
leafed through mail piled in the kitchen basket, 
searching 
charitable receipts and t3 slips. "dear mr. president," 
wrote saul bellow's herzog, 
"internal revenue regulations will turn us into a nation 
of bookkeepers." i settled 
at my desk, the surface strewn with tax. 
out the window, sun 
on the white wood of a torn branch, and still-bare 
branches rebounding from 
invisible trampolines, while something like the quietest 
wind seemed part 
of the tree-shadow on my neighbour's shed roof and 
the teacup-shadow on 
my littered desk—breathing in and 
breathing out 
what mary taylor 
used to say, when 
i'd meet her in the hallway. 
"how are you today, mary?" 
"oh, just breathing in and breathing out." 
ah 
then we went back to work.
