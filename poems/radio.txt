the kitchen dark, the summer night air warm, 
and my father at the kitchen table, radio 
turned down low, alone, listening to baseball. 
my mother and i come inside from our swim, 
toweling off. the crowd is restless. long silences 
between pitches in the play-by-play. 
look how he holds the radio in both hands 
like a steering wheel, thumb on the tuning dial 
to catch the wavering channel, fighting static. 
his eyes glitter like a field of fireflies.
