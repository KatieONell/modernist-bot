it names you gazelle and it calls 
lion. stomach churn and lung-hover, 
it reroutes the canal of your breath 
to quadriceps, large muscle clusters, 
the limbs you hold closer 
when the flowers arrive it says fire 
alarm. when the new lover or victim 
sits in the front row it says brimstone 
and it says yes to tequila and yes 
to shaking, always, knees and hands, 
under the arm of another woman it will name 
safety, it says go home with her, you must 
go home, avoid the tall grass and public 
places, the darkened lot, the stampede 
of small crowds and also solitude, go home, 
the amygdala says this 
is the savannah and you, 
a gazelle.
