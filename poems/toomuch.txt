a roman hired an 
artist, a freedman, 
to make a cone—pine-cone 
or fir-cone—with holes for a fountain. placed on 
the prison of st. angelo, this cone 
of the pompeys which is known 
now as the popes’, passed 
for art. a huge cast 
bronze, dwarfing the peacock 
statue in the garden of the vatican, 
it looks like a work of art made to give 
to a pompey, or native 
of thebes. others could 
build, and understood 
making colossi and 
how to use slaves, and kept crocodiles and put 
baboons on the necks of giraffes to pick 
fruit, and used serpent magic. 
they had their men tie 
hippopotami 
and bring out dapple dogcats 
to course antelopes, dikdik, and ibex; 
or used small eagles. they looked on as theirs, 
impalas and onagers, 
the wild ostrich herd 
with hard feet and bird 
necks rearing back in the 
dust like a serpent preparing to strike, cranes, 
storks, anoas, mongooses, and nile geese. 
and there were gardens for these— 
combining planes, dates, 
limes, and pomegranates, 
in avenues—with square 
pools of pink flowers, tame fish, and small frogs. besides 
yarns dyed with indigo, and red cotton, 
they had a flax which they spun 
into fine linen 
cordage for yachtsmen. 
these people liked small things; 
they gave to boys little paired playthings such as 
nests of eggs, ichneumon and snake, paddle 
and raft, badger and camel; 
and made toys for them- 
selves: the royal totem; 
and toilet-boxes marked 
with the contents. lords and ladies put goose-grease 
paint in round bone boxes with pivoting 
lid incised with the duck-wing 
or reverted duck- 
head; kept in a buck 
or rhinoceros horn, 
the ground horn; and locust oil in stone locusts. 
it was a picture with a fine distance; 
of drought, and of assistance 
in time, from the nile 
rising slowly, while 
the pig-tailed monkey on 
slab-hands, with arched-up slack-slung gait, and the brown 
dandy, looked at the jasmine two-leafed twig 
and bud, cactus-pads, and fig. 
dwarfs here and there, lent 
to an evident 
poetry of frog grays, 
duck-egg greens, and egg-plant blues, a fantasy 
and a verisimilitude that were 
right to those with, everywhere, 
power over the poor. 
the bees’ food is your 
food. those who tended flowerbeds 
and stables were like the king’s cane in the 
form of a hand, or the folding bedroom 
made for his mother of whom 
he was fond. princes 
clad in queens’ dresses 
calla or petunia 
white that trembled at the edge, and queens in a 
king’s underskirt of fine-twilled thread like silk- 
worm gut, as bee-man and milk- 
maid, kept divine cows 
and bees; limestone brows, 
and gold-foil wings. they made 
basalt serpents and portraits of beetles; the 
king gave his name to them and he was named 
for them. he feared snakes and tamed 
pharaoh’s rat, the rust- 
backed mongoose. no bust 
of it was made, but there 
was pleasure for the rat. its restlessness was 
its excellence; it was praised for its wit; 
and the jerboa, like it, 
a small desert rat, 
and not famous, that 
lives without water, has 
happiness. abroad seeking food, or at home 
in its burrow, the sahara field-mouse 
has a shining silver house 
of sand. o rest and 
joy, the boundless sand, 
the stupendous sand-spout, 
no water, no palm-trees, no ivory bed, 
tiny cactus; but one would not be he 
who has nothing but plenty. 
in costa rica 
in blazing driftwood 
the green keeps showing at the same place; 
as, intermittently, the fire-opal shows blue and green.
