they came to strike the pinata. 
the piã±ata hung from a crane 
and swayed, its swollen gut 
of newspaper and paste. 
they listened as the piã±ata creaked, 
a dock in choppy waters. 
they began to shout themselves to the brink. 
and standing there, watching the piã±ata, 
it seemed almost possible 
to forget the search that had continued 
since christmas, was it this one 
or the one before? 
parks, rivers, cupboards, drawers, 
the bent light beneath their decksâ€” 
what had they found? 
and standing there, the piã±ata swaying, 
they were gathered and ready 
with hammers, bats, knives and chains 
to smash and tear until the piã±ata's shanks 
could be nipped by dogs. 
though when the first seam split, 
some resorted to doubling over 
and pawing the grass. 
while others continued taking swings, 
the halved ones moved with new insistence, 
their hands sweeping over the ground 
like visible winds.
