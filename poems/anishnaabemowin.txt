this is what came before the world 
it was this 
that called the world 
into being 
so much older than what 
we speak now 
it has flowed through 
more of your ancestors 
than any other 
it has flowed within me 
even when i don't understand 
especially then 
i don't really know 
how you 
came into being 
it must have been this 
that called you
