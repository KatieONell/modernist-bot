the stage is cluttered with family members and smiles. you fill out index cards. press buttons. feel buoyed by laughter and attention. 
a question goes up on the board. you're in it to win it. you're not here to make friends. "what isâ€”the reason she says she drinks." (yay, points!) 
"what isâ€”reasons to lock your bedroom door." 
(points!)âââââââ(points!)âââââââ(points!) 
mom says, "i'll takeâ€”pretend it never happenedâ€”for 500." 
she sweeps the board. âââ(applause! cries!) 
it doesn't matter. you're pretty sure you're ahead. 
you're in the bonus round. you take turns. one person tells a secret, the others press either a true or a false button. the audience will shout the results from flashing lights you can't see. just above your heads, lit by the red glow, you can feel the verdict coming.
