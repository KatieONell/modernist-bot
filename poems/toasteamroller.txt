the illustration 
is nothing to you without the application. 
you lack half wit. you crush all the particles down 
into close conformity, and then walk back and forth on them. 
sparkling chips of rock 
are crushed down to the level of the parent block. 
were not "impersonal judgment in aesthetic matters, a metaphysical impossibility," you 
might fairly achieve 
it. as for butterflies, i can hardly conceive 
of one’s attending upon you, but to question 
the congruence of the complement is vain, if it exists.
