and i came to in a room with a draft 
that issued from beneath a swinging door, 
my head plugged up like a sink stuffed 
with months of shed hair, 
shaving stubble, other things 
that thought to disappear. 
and the covers were bunched 
at my waist like a marble effigy 
of christ newly sprung from the cross, 
unveiling an inch of midriff, 
my navel, which in the hospital light 
looked like a wound from a hollow-point. 
and the old man in a nearby bed 
kept dying. the monitor would shriek 
its air-raid warning and he would die 
and come back. that was his trick. 
he did it and did it. the slap-slap 
of the nurses' soles was deliberate 
applause. then he left for good. 
my wife said that when i was dead, 
or during my death, she paced the garden 
with my jacket on, cupping votive flames 
to cigarettes. she killed each 
match with a flick of her wrist, 
then laid the burnt corpses to rest 
in a packet scored with scratches 
from matchstick heads that sought 
to light the way, and did, and died. 
tendrils of smoke grew into the sky 
as vines climbing from tomblike shade. 
she stood, then, and helped me to my feet, 
led me down the corridor 
to find a cup of tea—past an orderly 
who wheeled an assemblage 
of bed, old woman, and iv— 
not looking back to see if i was there.
