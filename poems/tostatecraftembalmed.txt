there is nothing to be said for you. guard 
your secret. conceal it under your hard 
plumage, necromancer. 
o 
bird, whose tents were "awnings of egyptian 
yarn," shall justice’ faint, zigzag inscription— 
leaning like a dancer— 
show 
the pulse of its once vivid sovereignty? 
you say not, and transmigrating from the 
sarcophagus, you wind 
snow 
silence round us and with moribund talk, 
half limping and half ladified, you stalk 
about. ibis, we find 
no 
virtue in you—alive and yet so dumb. 
discreet behavior is not now the sum 
of statesmanlike good sense. 
though 
it were the incarnation of dead grace? 
as if a death mask ever could replace 
life’s faulty excellence! 
slow 
to remark the steep, too strict proportion 
of your throne, you’ll see the wrenched distortion 
of suicidal dreams 
go 
staggering toward itself and with its bill, 
attack its own identity, until 
foe seems friend and friend seems 
foe.
