messengers much like ourselves? explain it. 
steadfastness the darkness makes explicit? 
something heard most clearly when not near it? 
above particularities, 
these unparticularities praise cannot violate. 
one has seen, in such steadiness never deflected, 
how by darkness a star is perfected. 
star that does not ask me if i see it? 
fir that would not wish me to uproot it? 
speech that does not ask me if i hear it? 
mysteries expound mysteries. 
steadier than steady, star dazzling me, live and elate, 
no need to say, how like some we have known; too like her, 
too like him, and a-quiver forever.
