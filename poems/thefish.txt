wade 
through black jade. 
of the crow-blue mussel shells, one 
keeps 
adjusting the ash heaps; 
opening and shutting itself like 
an 
injured fan. 
the barnacles which encrust the 
side 
of the wave, cannot hide 
there for the submerged shafts of the 
sun, 
split like spun 
glass, move themselves with spotlight swift- 
ness 
into the crevices— 
in and out, illuminating 
the 
turquoise sea 
of bodies. the water drives a 
wedge 
of iron through the iron edge 
of the cliff, whereupon the stars, 
pink 
rice grains, ink 
bespattered jelly-fish, crabs like 
green 
lilies and submarine 
toadstools, slide each on the other. 
all 
external 
marks of abuse are present on 
this 
defiant edifice— 
all the physical features of 
ac- 
cident—lack 
of cornice, dynamite grooves, burns 
and 
hatchet strokes, these things stand 
out on it; the chasm side is 
dead. 
repeated 
evidence has proved that it can 
live 
on what cannot revive 
its youth. the sea grows old in it.
