women are cities & cities 
are humiliating. 
tourists haggle the price 
& somehow still pay double. 
the city is leaky 
& smells like fishwives. 
locals chide in dialect 
tangy as a faux leather belt. 
men are angry & angry men 
turn each other into volcanoes. 
what is it like to live 
in the shadow of a volcano? 
on the cusp of eruption 
it's exciting 
for the tourists. burning through 
their cash, it's all you can smell. 
volcanoes violate cities 
to ash & stone. it's a pity. 
i'd pumice my feet with it all if i could.
