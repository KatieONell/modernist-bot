the pin-swin or spine-swine 
(the edgehog miscalled hedgehog) with all his edges out, 
echidna and echinoderm in distressed- 
pin-cushion thorn-fur coats, the spiny pig or porcupine, 
the rhino with horned snout— 
everything is battle-dressed. 
pig-fur won’t do, i’ll wrap 
myself in salamander-skin like presbyter john. 
a lizard in the midst of flames, a firebrand 
that is life, asbestos-eyed asbestos-eared, with tattooed nap 
and permanent pig on 
the instep; he can withstand 
fire and won’t drown. in his 
unconquerable country of unpompous gusto, 
gold was so common none considered it; greed 
and flattery were unknown. though rubies large as tennis- 
balls conjoined in streams so 
that the mountain seemed to bleed, 
the inextinguishable 
salamander styled himself but presbyter. his shield 
was his humility. in carpasian 
linen coat, flanked by his household lion-cubs and sable 
retinue, he revealed 
a formula safer than 
an armorer’s: the power of relinquishing 
what one would keep; that is freedom. become dinosaur- 
skulled, quilled or salamander-wooled, more ironshod 
and javelin-dressed than a hedgehog battalion of steel, but be 
dull. don’t be envied or 
armed with a measuring-rod. 
propriety 
is some such word 
as the chord 
brahms had heard 
from a bird, 
sung down near the root of the throat; 
it’s the little downy woodpecker 
spiraling up a tree— 
up up up like mercury; 
a not long 
sparrow-song 
of hayseed 
magnitude— 
a tuned reticence with rigor
