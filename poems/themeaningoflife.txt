it could be that this line drawn taut 
between my fist and bonnie's kite— 
the nylon wings and plastic strut— 
is closer than i'll come to revelation. 
or trust, i mean, in the sort of heaven 
a feather's width between the fingertips 
of god and adam insinuates, 
their faith enduring on a chapel ceiling. 
i'm the kind of man whose mind 
is often flocked with herring gulls 
that dive for chicken skins in parking lots. 
and yet, at times, i almost grasp 
what's lost down on this lower plane: 
the pull of unseen hands, a gentle tug. 
tangled string; me staring up.
