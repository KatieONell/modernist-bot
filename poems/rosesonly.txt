you do not seem to realise that beauty is a liability rather than 
an asset—that in view of the fact that spirit creates form we are justified in supposing 
that you must have brains. for you, a symbol of the unit, stiff and sharp, 
conscious of surpassing by dint of native superiority and liking for everything 
self-dependent, anything an 
ambitious civilization might produce: for you, unaided to attempt through sheer 
reserve, to confute presumptions resulting from observation, is idle. you cannot make us 
think you a delightful happen-so. but rose, if you are brilliant, it 
is not because your petals are the without-which-nothing of pre-eminence. you would, minus thorns, 
look like a what-is-this, a mere 
peculiarity. they are not proof against a worm, the elements, or mildew 
but what about the predatory hand? what is brilliance without co-ordination? guarding the 
infinitesimal pieces of your mind, compelling audience to 
the remark that it is better to be forgotten than to be remembered too violently, 
your thorns are the best part of you.
