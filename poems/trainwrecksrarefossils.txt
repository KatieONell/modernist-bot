ввввввввввввввввввввwhen i first saw them, slipped 
from his woollen swim-trunks, so shamelessly 
war-time and loose at the inner thigh, 
вввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввв i was surprised 
to find what finally made a man 
вввввввввв a man, this bruised fruit 
like something forgotten in a lunch pailвЂ” 
вввввввввввввввввввв this was what all the fuss was about 
when the boys clutched themselves, keeled over 
in mock pain like big cry-babies. 
ввввввввввввввввввввthat every boy who taunted me 
вввввввввв should have an awkward, jiggering set 
of something akin to my mother's 
bitter tulip bulbs (i'd once tasted one on a whim) 
вввввввввввввввввввв well, it seemed a cruel joke 
how i'd flowered into being 
ввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввas a wary child. 
ввввввввввввввввввввand when in september 
the teacher asked us, restless one by one, 
ввввввввввввввввввввto name the things learned in our summers away, 
a few swept faces clearly coy or lying 
ввввввввввввввввввввin reports of train wrecks or rare fossils, 
вввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввввв i thought of my father, 
that puzzlement of flesh and flounce between his legs, 
his frailty bared, 
вввввввввв and wondered how my mother did it, 
kept him safe; 
when once i'd believed my father, 
secret and entireвЂ” 
вввввввввввввввввввввввввввввв someone to be watched 
in a fearless diving from the bright shore 
into the dark, stirred watersвЂ” 
вввввввввв and said nothing.
