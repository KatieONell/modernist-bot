when i first saw them, slipped 
from his woollen swim-trunks, so shamelessly 
war-time and loose at the inner thigh, 
i was surprised 
to find what finally made a man 
a man, this bruised fruit 
like something forgotten in a lunch pail— 
this was what all the fuss was about 
when the boys clutched themselves, keeled over 
in mock pain like big cry-babies. 
that every boy who taunted me 
should have an awkward, jiggering set 
of something akin to my mother's 
bitter tulip bulbs (i'd once tasted one on a whim) 
well, it seemed a cruel joke 
how i'd flowered into being 
as a wary child. 
and when in september 
the teacher asked us, restless one by one, 
to name the things learned in our summers away, 
a few swept faces clearly coy or lying 
in reports of train wrecks or rare fossils, 
i thought of my father, 
that puzzlement of flesh and flounce between his legs, 
his frailty bared, 
and wondered how my mother did it, 
kept him safe; 
when once i'd believed my father, 
secret and entire— 
someone to be watched 
in a fearless diving from the bright shore 
into the dark, stirred waters— 
and said nothing.
