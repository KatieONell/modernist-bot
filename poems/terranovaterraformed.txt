spent shale, thigh haptic fisher, roe, river 
delta of sleep-inducing peptides abet our tent 
in a deep time course, in venus retrograde 
we coalesced into the cartesian floral pattern 
of heritage where i hunt along a creek as 
you pack bits of bone away within a system 
of conservation the site was discovered 
during construction of a new venous 
highway for stars birthing themselves 
out of pyroclastic dust and telepathy 
in the time zone of some desperate hour 
when all our exits are terraformed 
sons and daughters of the liberal arts 
all my life has spurned a desire for more than 
a power line of injured transistors 
fetal alcohol syndrome, oil drums sunk 
to the bottom of every lake, the aurora borealis 
an overdose along the magnetized pole 
what we are offered in lieu of a soul 
another paper cut of lambent plasma 
thickening the wound bed of release: 
o creek, bleeding hills, census inveterate 
let me sleep five more minutes just five 
minutes more before we default on 
eternity
