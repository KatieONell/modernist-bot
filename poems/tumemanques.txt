is how the french miss. 
backward. like car wheels in commercials. 
you me miss. every possible word in the wrong 
place. there are only three. 
i had a 
farm in africa, no just a friend on the french-swiss 
border who argued the english i miss you 
didn't make any sense. had? how could you 
meaning me miss you meaning him. easy. 
you he explained miss me because we are not together. 
who's missing? i wanted to know. you are. you are 
gone somewhere from me. la lune. i cannot be missing 
from myself. ever. you are missing from me and here 
he clamped a love handle and that causes me great 
how do you say l'angoisse. 
we are apart now 
we never met actually we skyped our whole 
drosophiliac friendship together. he made a joke once 
when i asked for details (he had a postdoc 
on breast cancer proteins) that he was in charge 
of terminating the rats. by guillotine. that was the joke. 
then he spoke very quickly the real way—an injection 
i think. how faint the tune. i could never tell 
how tall he was or ask correctly how high 
the moon. 
as long as we're longing i had a 
farm in africa, no just another friend on the border 
of rwanda and the congo who said i miss you 
for tu me manques was a perfect and incorrect 
translation. just trust me. everything makes sense 
until you have to explain it. have? you don't say 
tu m'aimes for i love you. correct. that is very true 
but surtout because i don't love you. see the stars 
how they shine for you. wait, wait, wait. not you, 
not your words, not your feeling.
