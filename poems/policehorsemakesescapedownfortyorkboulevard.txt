pike dialled 911. 
some sooty bay, 
mahogany, or other 
ambiguity of brown 
wearing a lime-green 
vest, cantered down 
the condo-ed boulevard 
un-policed, not panicked 
but with purpose. yeah, 
i think he's one of yours. 
heading for the gardiner. 
pike dialled 911. 
it was the sound 
that spurred him 
to the window. not 
that flimsy, foleyed 
cobblestone effect 
but calamitously real. 
anachronistic prophecy: 
the past is clamorous 
and mean, and steals 
the present as it flees. 
pike dialled 911. 
put his sandwich down 
and picked his camera up. 
time froze, adventure-less 
as snow, like stupefying 
parkette art, or tellers' smiles 
at the bmo. only 
the horse running now 
beneath the underpass 
toward home, the palace, 
those hay-crammed stables, 
to feast, like history, 
on today's brief freedom.
