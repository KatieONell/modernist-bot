love is a moontime teaching 
is your kookum's crooked smile when you pick up the phone 
is another word for body 
body is another word for campfire smoke 
campfire smoke is the smell he leaves behind in your bed sheets after 
the breakup 
the word for hate sex is forest 
forest sometimes means hope or lonely (depends on who you ask) 
lonely is a movie called taxi zum klo about white gay men 
who risk tiptoeing through desire's minefields 
for ten minutes of something better than living 
living is going to bingo to pay the bills 
after you quit your job that barely paid the bills 
paying the bills is sometimes a metaphor for cancer 
cancer is a diagnosis handed down to an 18-year old girl from the rez 
the rez is another word for body 
the body is a myth 
is the only good news the doctor gives you when your cells run amok 
amok is the border the skin doesn't remember 
how to secure anymore 
anymore is the feeling you get when a police officer 
pulls you over because he thinks you're driving a stolen vehicle 
a stolen vehicle is the nickname you give to love.
