i attended school and i liked the place— 
grass and little locust-leaf shadows like lace. 
writing was discussed. they said, "we create 
values in the process of living, daren’t await 
their historic progress." be abstract 
and you’ll wish you’d been specific; it’s a fact. 
what was i studying? values in use, 
"judged on their own ground." am i still abstruse? 
walking along, a student said offhand, 
"‘relevant’ and ‘plausible’ were words i understand." 
a pleasing statement, anonymous friend. 
certainly the means must not defeat the end.
