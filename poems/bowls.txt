on the green 
with lignum vitae balls and ivory markers, 
the pins planted in wild duck formation, 
and quickly dispersed: 
by this survival of ancient punctilio 
in the manner of chinese lacquer carving, 
layer after layer exposed by certainty of touch and unhurried incision 
so that only so much color shall be revealed as is necessary to the picture 
i learn that we are precisians— 
not citizens of pompeii arrested in action 
as a cross section of one’s correspondence would seem to imply. 
renouncing a policy of boorish indifference 
to everything that has been said since the days of matilda, 
i shall purchase an etymological dictionary of modern english 
that i may understand what is written 
and like the ant and the spider 
returning from time to time to headquarters, 
shall answer the question 
as to "why i like winter better than i like summer" 
and acknowledge that it does not make me sick 
to look modern playwrights and poets and novelists straight in the face— 
that i feel just the same; 
and i shall write to the publisher of the magazine 
which will "appear the first day of the month 
and disappear before one has had time to buy it 
unless one takes proper precaution," 
and make an effort to please— 
since he who gives quickly gives twice 
in nothing so much as in a letter.
