with innocent wide penguin eyes, three 
grown fledgling mocking-birds below 
the pussy-willow tree, 
stand in a row, 
wings touching, feebly solemn, 
till they see 
their no longer larger 
mother bringing 
something which will partially 
feed one of them. 
towards the high-keyed intermittent squeak 
of broken carriage-springs, made by 
the three similar, meek- 
coated bird’s-eye 
freckled forms she comes; and when 
from the beak 
of one, the still living 
beetle has dropped 
out, she picks it up and puts 
it in again. 
standing in the shade till they have dressed 
their thickly-filamented, pale 
pussy-willow-surfaced 
coats, they spread tail 
and wings, showing one by one, 
the modest 
white stripe lengthwise on the 
tail and crosswise 
on the under wing, and the 
accordion 
is closed again. what delightful note 
with rapid unexpected flute- 
sounds leaping from the throat 
of the astute 
grown bird comes back to one from 
the remote 
unenergetic sun- 
lit air before 
the brood was here? why has the 
bird’s voice become 
harsh? a piebald cat observing them, 
is slowly creeping toward the trim 
trio on the tree-stem. 
unused to him 
the three make room—uneasy 
new problem. 
a dangling foot that missed 
its grasp, is raised 
and finds the twig on which it 
planned to perch. the 
parent darting down, nerved by what chills 
the blood, and by hope rewarded— 
of toil—since nothing fills 
squeaking unfed 
mouths, wages deadly combat, 
and half kills 
with bayonet beak and 
cruel wings, the 
intellectual, cautious- 
l y c r e e p i n g c a t.
