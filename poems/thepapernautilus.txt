for authorities whose hopes 
are shaped by mercenaries? 
writers entrapped by 
teatime fame and by 
commuters’ comforts? not for these 
the paper nautilus 
constructs her thin glass shell. 
giving her perishable 
souvenir of hope, a dull 
white outside and smooth- 
edged inner surface 
glossy as the sea, the watchful 
maker of it guards it 
day and night; she scarcely 
eats until the eggs are hatched. 
buried eight-fold in her eight 
arms, for she is in 
a sense a devil- 
fish, her glass ramshorn-cradled freight 
is hid but is not crushed. 
as hercules, bitten 
by a crab loyal to the hydra, 
was hindered to succeed, 
the intensively 
watched eggs coming from 
the shell free it when they are freed,— 
leaving its wasp-nest flaws 
of white on white, and close- 
laid ionic chiton-folds 
like the lines in the mane of 
a parthenon horse, 
round which the arms had 
wound themselves as if they knew love 
is the only fortress 
strong enough to trust to.
