derived from "golden fleece of the arctic," by john j. teal, jr., who rears musk oxen on his farm in vermont, as set forth in the march 1958 issue of the atlantic monthly. 
to wear the arctic fox 
you have to kill it. wear 
qiviut—the underwool of the arctic ox— 
pulled off it like a sweater; 
your coat is warm; your conscience, better. 
i would like a suit of 
qiviut, so light i did not 
know i had it on; and in the 
course of time, another 
since i had not had to murder 
the "goat" that grew the fleece 
that made the first. the musk ox 
has no musk and it is not an ox— 
illiterate epithet. 
bury your nose in one when wet. 
it smells of water, nothing else, 
and browses goatlike on 
hind legs. its great distinction 
is not egocentric scent 
but that it is intelligent. 
chinchillas, otters, water rats, 
and beavers keep us warm 
but think! a "musk ox" grows six pounds 
of qiviut; the cashmere ram, 
three ounces—that is all—of pashm. 
lying in an exposed spot, 
basking in the blizzard, 
these ponderosos could dominate 
the rare-hairs market in kashan and yet 
you could not have a choicer pet. 
they join you as you work; 
love jumping in and out of holes, 
play in water with the children, 
learn fast, know their names, 
will open gates and invent games. 
while not incapable 
of courtship, they may find its 
servitude and flutter, too much 
like procrustes’ bed; 
so some decide to stay unwed. 
camels are snobbish 
and sheep, unintelligent; 
water buffaloes, neurasthenic— 
even murderous. 
reindeer seem over-serious, 
whereas these scarce qivies, 
with golden fleece and winning ways, 
outstripping every fur-bearer— 
there in vermont quiet— 
could demand bold ruler’s diet: 
mountain valley water, 
dandelions, carrots, oats— 
encouraged as well—by bed 
made fresh three times a day, 
to roll and revel in the hay. 
insatiable for willow 
leaves alone, our goatlike 
qivi-curvi-capricornus 
sheds down ideal for a nest. 
song-birds find qiviut best. 
suppose you had a bag 
of it; you could spin a pound 
into a twenty-four-or-five- 
mile thread—one, forty-ply— 
that will not shrink in any dye. 
if you fear that you are 
reading an advertisement, 
you are. if we can’t be cordial 
to these creatures’ fleece, 
i think that we deserve to freeze. 
saint nicholas, 
might i, if you can find it, be given 
a chameleon with tail 
that curls like a watch spring; and vertical 
on the body—including the face—pale 
tiger-stripes, about seven; 
(the melanin in the skin 
having been shaded from the sun by thin 
bars; the spinal dome 
beaded along the ridge 
as if it were platinum). 
if you can find no striped chameleon, 
might i have a dress or suit— 
i guess you have heard of it—of qiviut? 
and to wear with it, a taslon shirt, the drip-dry fruit 
of research second to none; 
sewn, i hope, by excello; 
as for buttons to keep down the collar-points, no. 
the shirt could be white— 
and be "worn before six," 
either in daylight or at night. 
but don’t give me, if i can’t have the dress, 
a trip to greenland, or grim 
trip to the moon. the moon should come here. let him 
make the trip down, spread on my dark floor some dim 
marvel, and if a success 
that i stoop to pick up and wear, 
i could ask nothing more. a thing yet more rare, 
though, and different, 
would be this: hans von marées’ 
st. hubert, kneeling with head bent, 
form erect—in velvet, tense with restraint— 
hand hanging down: the horse, free. 
not the original, of course. give me 
a postcard of the scene—huntsman and divinity— 
hunt-mad hubert startled into a saint 
by a stag with a figure entined. 
but why tell you what you must have divined?
