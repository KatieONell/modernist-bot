before it became laguardia airport 
hurry, worry, unwary 
visitor, never vary 
the pressure till nearly bat-blind. 
a predicament so dire could not 
occur in this rare spot— 
where crowds flock to the tramcar, 
rattling greenish caterpillar, 
as bowling-ball thunder 
quivers the air. the park’s elephant 
slowly lies down aslant; 
then pygmy replica rides 
the mound the back provides. 
jet black, a furry pony sits 
down like a dog, has an innocent air— 
no tricks—the best act there. 
it’s all like the never-ending 
ferris-wheel ascending 
picket-fenced pony-rides (ten cents). 
a businessman, the pony-paddock boy 
locks his equestrian toy— 
flags flying, fares collected, 
shooting gallery neglected— 
half-official, half-sequestered, 
limber-slouched against a post, 
and tells a friend what matters least. 
it’s the old park in a nutshell, 
like its tame-wild carrousel— 
the exhilarating peak 
when the triumph is reflective 
and confusion, retroactive.
