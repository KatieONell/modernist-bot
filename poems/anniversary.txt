it has taken five years and fifteen hundred 
kilometres to get away, and closer 
to the mountains. i can see them— 
every day, like i always wanted. near, 
and distant. every day i can ask people 
not to touch me— 
on the bus, on the beach, or in my new kitchen. 
or, i could ask them to— 
which, lately, is harder. how can it still 
feel so soon? she has never been 
near this new body of mine— 
short-haired, tattooed, very strong 
and very, very fast, now. i carry a chunk of rose 
quartz the size of my thumb for safety. 
i have sworn to myself a life of people 
who know when to stop. i promised— 
and spent my first night in the new apartment drawing 
circles in salt and rain, whispering 
to my old self, come here. i built this 
for you. i promised.
