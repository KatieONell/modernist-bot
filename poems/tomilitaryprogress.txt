you use your mind 
like a millstone to grind 
chaff. 
you polish it 
and with your warped wit 
laugh 
at your torso, 
prostrate where the crow 
falls 
on such faint hearts 
as its god imparts, 
calls 
and claps its wings 
till the tumult brings 
more 
black minute-men 
to revive again, 
war 
at little cost. 
they cry for the lost 
head 
and seek their prize 
till the evening skyâ€™s 
red
