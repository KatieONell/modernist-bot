that morning in the motel 
where your best friend lived, 
new snow outside, at least in the memory 
and the stranger—he was eighteen, 
you were alone, she was downstairs 
at the pop machine or something 
while you watched the snow, the nest 
of beached antlers in the yard 
behind the pine trees and then he was there, too 
in the room, telling you about 
a guitar, or something useless 
and you thought 
empty room, you thought quiet house, 
you were a very smart girl and you felt 
the footstep he took one step closer behind you 
at the window, and from the rising star 
of your gut you heard it, like twin 
drops of water—you have to leave the room 
right. now. and quietly, and you did. 
that was smart. you were a smart 
girl, and you did not tell anyone 
not when they found out he was 
in her room at night, not 
when they sent him away, not 
until you were a grown woman, and what 
you wouldn't give 
for that little voice again, now.
