even with its own ax to grind, sometimes 
helps others. why can’t it help me? 
o imagnifico, 
wizard in words—poet, was it, as 
alfredo panzini defined you? 
weren’t you refracting just now 
on my eye’s half-closed triptych 
the image, enhanced, of a glen— 
"the foxgrape festoon as sere leaves fell" 
on the sand-pale dark byroad, one leaf adrift 
from the thin-twigged persimmon; again, 
a bird—arizona 
caught-up-with, uncatchable cuckoo 
after two hours’ pursuit, zigzagging 
road-runner, stenciled in black 
stripes all over, the tail 
windmilling up to defy me? 
you understand terror, know how to deal 
with pent-up emotion, a ballad, witchcraft. 
i don’t. o zeus and o destiny! 
unafraid of what’s done, 
undeterred by apparent defeat, 
you, imagnifico, unafraid 
of disparagers, death, dejection, 
have out-wiled the mermaid of zennor, 
made wordcraft irresistible: 
reef, wreck, lost lad, and "sea-foundered bell"— 
as near a thing as we have to a king— 
craft with which i don’t know how to deal.
