pale sand edges englandâ€™s old 
dominion. the air is soft, warm, hot, 
above the cedar-dotted emerald shore 
known to the redbird, 
the redcoated musketeer, 
the trumpet-flower, the cavalier, 
the parson, and the 
wild parishioner. a deer- 
track in a church-floor 
brick and sir george yeardleyâ€™s 
coffin-tacks and tomb remain. 
the now tremendous vine-en- 
compassed hackberry 
starred with the ivy-flower, 
shades the church tower. 
and "a great sinner lyeth here" under 
the sycamore. 
a fritillary zigzags 
toward the seemly resting-place of this 
unusual man and pleasing sinner who 
"waits for a joyful 
resurrection." we-re-wo- 
comocoâ€™s fur crown could be no 
odder than we were 
with ostrich, latin motto, 
and small gold horse-shoe, 
as arms for an able 
sting-ray-hampered pioneer, 
painted as a turk it seems, 
the incessantly 
exciting captain smith 
who patient with 
his inferiors, was a pugnacious 
equal; and to 
powhatan obliged, but not 
a flatterer. rare indian, crowned by 
christopher newport! the old dominion has 
all-green grass-hoppers 
in all-green, box-sculptured grounds; 
an almost english green surrounds 
them. care has formed a- 
mong unenglish insect sounds, 
the white wall-rose. as 
thick as daniel booneâ€™s grape- 
vine, the stem has wide-spaced great 
blunt alternating ostrich- 
skin warts that were thorns. 
care has formed walls of yew 
since indians knew 
the fort old field and narrow neck of land 
that jamestown was. 
observe the terse virginian, 
the mettlesome gray one that drives the 
owl from tree to tree and imitates the call 
of whippoorwill or 
lark or katydidâ€”the leadgray 
lead-legged mocking-bird with head 
held half away, and 
meditative eye as dead 
as sculptured marble 
eye, alighting noiseless, 
muses in the semi-sun, 
standing on tall thin legs as 
if he did not see, 
conspicuous, alone, 
on the round stonetopped 
table with lead cupids grouped to form 
the pedestal. 
narrow herring-bonelaid bricks, 
a dusty pink beside the dwarf box- 
bordered pansies, share the ivy-arbor shade 
with cemetery 
lace settees, one at each side, 
and with the bird: box-bordered tide- 
water gigantic 
jet black pansies (splendor; pride;) 
not for a decade 
dressed, but for a day, in 
overpowering velvet; and 
gray blue-andalusian 
cock-feather pale ones 
ink-lined on the edge, fur- 
eyed, with ochre 
on the cheek. the slowmoving glossy, tall 
quick cavalcade 
of buckeye-brown surprising 
jumpers, the contrasting work-mule and 
show-mule \& witch-cross door \& "strong sweet prison" 
are part of what 
has come about, in the black 
idiom, from advancing backward 
in a circle; 
from taking the potomac 
cowbirdlike; and on 
the chickahominy 
establishing the negro, opportunely brought, to strength- 
en protest against 
tyranny. rare unscent- 
ed, providently 
hot, too sweet, inconsistent flowerbed! 
old dominion 
earth makes sunflower-heads grow large; 
hibiscus and so-called mimosa 
close at night; the scarlet peculiarly-quilled 
pomegranate-petals, 
the african violet, 
and camellia, perfumeless. yet 
house-high glistening green 
magnolia-trees with velvet- 
textured flower, are filled 
with anaesthetic scent 
enough to make one die; as 
the gardenia is, though its 
two-toned green-furled buds 
and dark leaf-vein on green- 
er leaf when seen 
against the light attract no pigmy bees 
such as the frilled 
silk substanceless faint flower of 
the crape-myrtle does. odd pamunkey 
princess, birdclaw-earringed; with a pet raccoon 
from the mattapo- 
ni (what a bear!) feminine 
odd indian young lady! odd thin- 
gauze-and-taffeta- 
dressed english one! terrapin 
meat and crested spoon 
feed the mistress of french 
plum-and-turquoise-piped chaise-longue; 
of brass-knobbed slat front-door and 
everywhere open 
shaded house on indian- 
named virginian 
streams, in counties named for english lords. the 
rattlesnake soon 
said from our once dashingly 
undiffident first flag, "donâ€™t tread on 
me," tactless symbol of a new republic. 
priorities were 
cradled in this region not 
noted for humility; spot 
that has high-singing 
frogs, cotton-mouth snakes and cot- 
ton-fields; clay for brick, 
lawrence jugs with persian 
loping wolf design; and hounds. 
here the poor unpoisonous 
terrapin likes to 
idle near the sea-top; 
tobacco-crop 
gains have church tablets; devilâ€™s woodyard swamps 
and one-brick-thick- 
wall serpentine shadows star- 
tle strangers. the strangler fig, the dwarf- 
fancying egyptian, the american, 
the dutch, the noble 
roman, in taking what they 
pleasedâ€”colonizing as we sayâ€” 
were not all intel- 
lect and delicacy. a 
black savage or such 
as was subject to the 
deer-fur crown is not all brawn 
and animality. the 
limestone tea-table, 
the mandolin-shaped big 
and little fig, 
and the now disused silkworm-trees, imply 
amity; much 
kind tyranny made ha-has 
that kept back cows; clock-strengthened stocking 
and drooping cotton dress with handmade edge, mark 
tyrant taste; the song- 
bird wakes too soon, to enjoy 
excellent idleness, destroy- 
ing legitimate 
laziness, this unbought toy 
even in the dark 
risking loud whee whee whee 
of joy, the caraway-seed- 
spotted sparrow perched in the 
dew-drenched juniper 
beside the window-ledge; 
the little hedgesparrow 
that wakes up seven minutes soon- 
er than the lark 
they say. the live oakâ€™s rounded 
mass of undulating boughs, the white 
pine, the agã¨d hackberryâ€”handsomest vis- 
itor of allâ€”the 
cedarâ€™s etched solidity, 
the cypress, lose identity 
and are one tree, as 
sunset flames increasingly 
against their leaf-chis- 
elled blackening ridge of green; 
and the redundantly wind- 
widened clouds expanding to 
earth size above the 
townâ€™s bothered with wages 
childish sages, 
are to the child an intimation of 
what glory is.
