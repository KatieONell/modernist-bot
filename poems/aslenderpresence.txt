in the hot 
late afternoon i read you, vergil, 
in my heart, your book not in my hands, 
amid crowds in the reflective 
oven of cement—crowds half naked 
as nymphs in a blue and ochre 
mosaic fountain basin, 
but sweating, suffering, 
rejoicing in the excuse for nudity, 
ignoring as much as may be 
their ugliness, paining for relief. 
without knowing it, they were existing 
in your rome. everywhere in my world, 
my today, is in your rome. 
here, as there, white gray slabs 
milled from nature 
clad every side except the sky 
and redouble the sun, 
making it evil. but in your day, everywhere 
but that one city—prophet of my world 
all one city—was vineyard and field, 
a vista waving, oak and vine, 
the herd and hive, the many 
dark forests, homes 
of hamadryads, abductions—stories— 
monsters—the boar, the snake. . . 
dark forests and the fountain-like 
clear lament always there 
for the naked dead girl and boy. 
but today is concrete and this summer 
not many read you on bench or bus 
and i too will soon go back 
to the songs of my time. you 
are dispersed 
in the humid atmosphere like a snowflake 
that fell in the wrong season and disappeared 
before it touched the ground. your voice 
from beauty to horror, 
resurrection to death, 
makes whatever contribution to this july 
a snowflake left over from early spring can make, 
whatever irrigation it is that flows 
to cracked meadows 
from the light snow that fell in a boy's gaze 
ages ago one may at mediolanum.
