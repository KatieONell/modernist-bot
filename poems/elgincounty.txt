in my mother's black kia‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚driving home from my grandparents' 
on christmas eve eve 
through white-blue snow clumped‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚in the diminished wheat fields 
surrounding 
threadbare barns and abandoned grey houses‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚whiter snow hanging 
on the dark pines 
like shearling trim along the highway‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚the sky saturated with itself 
and lines of geese 
and white and grey flycatchers‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚while voracious crows interpret 
the innards 
of roadkill deer and raccoons‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚and no people really just the radio 
in and out 
pop holiday classics‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚and the cbc hourly counting catastrophes 
while just hours before 
i pressed my grandmother‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚at her long dining table on the french 
cousin who died 
in another stretch of farmland‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚the gay architect-turned-artist 
returned from england 
with cancer of the mouth‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚and‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚my mother said aids‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚in a pause 
inserted the word 
like a pill beneath the tongue‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚aids‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚as if we could mistake it 
cancer of the mouth 
for parenthetical‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚as if‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚how terrible‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚ the words‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚aids 
on all our tongues‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚cancer 
of the mouth‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚even if not spoken‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚the diagnosis confirmed 
they think 
in the bright living room‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚of one or another cousin‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚she's not sure 
and‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚how terrible 
he was thirty-seven i think‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚they think‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚and his sister 
now has a daughter‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚pink 
and white‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚an innocent‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚and‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚she is the family joy 
and‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚i stared at my grandmother 
her face lit by a pair‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚‚of tiffany lamps on the maple hutch 
wondering 
where my widow's peak came from if not from her
