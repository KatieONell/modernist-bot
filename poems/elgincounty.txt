in my mother's black kiadriving home from my grandparents' 
on christmas eve eve 
through white-blue snow clumpedin the diminished wheat fields 
surrounding 
threadbare barns and abandoned grey houseswhiter snow hanging 
on the dark pines 
like shearling trim along the highwaythe sky saturated with itself 
and lines of geese 
and white and grey flycatcherswhile voracious crows interpret 
the innards 
of roadkill deer and raccoonsand no people really just the radio 
in and out 
pop holiday classicsand the cbc hourly counting catastrophes 
while just hours before 
i pressed my grandmotherat her long dining table on the french 
cousin who died 
in another stretch of farmlandthe gay architect-turned-artist 
returned from england 
with cancer of the mouthandmy mother said aidsin a pause 
inserted the word 
like a pill beneath the tongueaidsas if we could mistake it 
cancer of the mouth 
for parentheticalas ifhow terrible the wordsaids 
on all our tonguescancer

andi stared at my grandmother 
her face lit by a pairof tiffany lamps on the maple hutch 
wondering 
where my widow's peak came from if not from her
