or what is closer to the truth, 
when i look at that of which i may regard myself as the imaginary possessor, 
i fix upon what would give me pleasure in my average moments: 
the satire upon curiosity in which no more is discernible than the intensity of the mood; 
or quite the opposite—the old thing, the medieval decorated hat-box, 
in which there are hounds with waists diminishing like the waist of the hourglass 
and deer and birds and seated people; 
it may be no more than a square of parquetry; the literal biography perhaps, 
in letters standing well apart upon a parchment-like expanse; 
an artichoke in six varieties of blue; the snipe-legged hieroglyphic in three parts; 
the silver fence protecting adam’s grave, or michael taking adam by the wrist. 
too stern an intellectual emphasis upon this quality or that, detracts from one’s enjoyment; 
it must not wish to disarm anything; nor may the approved triumph easily be honored— 
that which is great because something else is small. 
it comes to this: of whatever sort it is, 
it must be "lit with piercing glances into the life of things"; 
it must acknowledge the spiritual forces which have made it.
