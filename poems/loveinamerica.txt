whatever it is, it’s a passion— 
a benign dementia that should be 
engulfing america, fed in a way 
the opposite of the way 
in which the minotaur was fed. 
it’s a midas of tenderness; 
from the heart; 
nothing else. from one with ability 
to bear being misunderstood— 
take the blame, with "nobility 
that is action," identifying itself with 
pioneer unperfunctoriness 
without brazenness or 
bigness of overgrown 
undergrown shallowness. 
whatever it is, let it be without 
affectation. 
yes, yes, yes, yes.
