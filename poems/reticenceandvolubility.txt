"when i am dead," 
the wizard said, 
"i’ll look upon the narrow way 
and this dante, 
and know that he was right 
and he’ll delight 
in my remorse, 
of course." 
"when i am dead," 
the student said, 
"i shall have grown so tolerant, 
i’ll find i can’t 
laugh at your sorry plight 
or take delight 
in your chagrin, 
merlin."
