"i am not treacherous, callous, jealous, superstitious, 
supercilious, venomous, or absolutely hideous": 
studying and studying its expression, 
exasperated desperation 
though at no real impasse, 
would gladly break the glass; 
when love of order, ardor, uncircuitous simplicity, 
with an expression of inquiry, are all one needs to be! 
certain faces, a few, one or two—or one 
face photographed by recollection— 
to my mind, to my sight, 
must remain a delight.
