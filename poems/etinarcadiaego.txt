hard to make out a particular figure: the faces 
pressed to the portholes, seeds stowed in oily 
cloth, or a swaying lamp altering the hold. 
the actual vessel & the metamorphic bridge of 
a husband & wife: a ladder across the ocean, two 
horses over land, the first stake as a crude house 
coalesces from the forest. and we to thy service 
build our homes on the acres, & as one generation 
begins to stabilize the mirage with basswood & moss, 
the i must or else the wintry land will have them 
relaxes its grip on the family: barns tatter, rust 
builds in the shed, field marking boulders slip 
back asleep as trains bear the children away to 
lift toil from the bones of the hand like a scythe 
& try to balance it against a desk in their heads. 
some take podiums, some preach, one will invest in 
machinery after a bullet whizzing through a tent turned 
hair white as he stitched things back inside men. 
still others will undergo the loss of their minds 
as if the same sheer will that seeded the stolen land 
planted also a chaos that came boiling up like oil 
or else they drifted through towns like glaciers, calved 
in thin blue lunacy to commune with something terribly 
wide. so our heads may have grown thick with others' 
reflexes & to flinch under shadows in the ceiling might be 
a house born burning in the child's mind. o distant country 
perpetual, fields, fields of rye—even in arcadia, there am i.
