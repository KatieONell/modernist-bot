there is a great amount of poetry in unconscious 
fastidiousness. certain ming 
products, imperial floor coverings of coach wheel yellow, are well enough in their way but i have seen something 
that i like betterâ€”a 
mere childish attempt to make an imperfectly ballasted animal stand up, 
similar determination to make a pup 
eat his meat on the plate. 
i remember a swan under the willows in oxford 
with flamingo colored, maple- 
leaflike feet. it reconnoitered like a battle ship. disbelief and conscious fastidiousness were the staple 
ingredients in its 
disinclination to move. finally its hardihood was not proof against its 
proclivity to more fully appraise such bits 
of food as the stream 
bore counter to it; it made away with what i gave it 
to eat. i have seen this swan and 
i have seen you; i have seen ambition without understanding in a variety of forms. happening to stand 
by an ant hill, i have 
seen a fastidious ant carrying a stick, north, south, east, west, till it turned on 
itself, struck out from the flower bed into the lawn, 
and returned to the point 
from which it had started. then abandoning the stick as 
useless and overtaxing its 
jaws with a particle of whitewash pill-like but heavy, it again went through the same course of procedure. what is 
there in being able 
to say that one has dominated the stream in an attitude of self defense, 
in proving that one has had the experience 
of carrying a stick?
