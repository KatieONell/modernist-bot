the first day, the fire climbed the slash like a jungle gym and leapt to the canopy. we dug out eight kilometers of hand line where the slope was too steep for the cat. i snapped a pulaski and ground my palms to burger. thank god we're not a dry camp. the next three days, the pump rattled like a datsun cresting the coquihalla. it sucked from the pond until the shallows quivered with a jelly of tadpoles. we drew a circle in two-inch hose and bare soil and called the fire contained. if anyone asks, kamloops, the fire is contained. we spend our overtime among the black spires of burnt fir, sniffing for the socks-on-the- camp-stove scent of smouldering duff. i wake up pawing the motel carpet for hot spots. a voice on the handheld asks if i remember my old life. i remember ground fire creeping from root to root, approaching an interface with the unspoken. a threat under the surface. now, i could load my duffel into a chopper and fly, nose down, along the seam of the present tense. self-sufficient for twenty-four hours with a bird's-eye view of the point of ignition.
