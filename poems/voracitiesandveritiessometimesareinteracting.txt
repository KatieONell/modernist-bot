i don’t like diamonds; 
the emerald’s "grass-lamp glow" is better; 
and unobtrusiveness is dazzling, 
upon occasion. 
some kinds of gratitude are trying. 
poets, don’t make a fuss; 
the elephant’s "crooked trumpet" "doth write"; 
and to a tiger-book i am reading— 
i think you know the one— 
i am under obligation. 
one may be pardoned, yes i know 
one may, for love undying.
