with an elephant to ride upon — "with rings on her fingers and bells on her toes," 
she shall outdistance calamity anywhere she goes. 
speed is not in her mind inseparable from carpets. locomotion arose 
in the shape of an elephant; she clambered up and chose 
to travel laboriously. so far as magic carpets are concerned, she knows 
that although the semblance of speed may attach to scarecrows 
of aesthetic procedure, the substance of it is embodied in such of those 
tough-grained animals as have outstripped man’s whim to suppose 
them ephemera, and have earned that fruit of their ability to endure blows, 
which dubs them prosaic necessities—not curios.
