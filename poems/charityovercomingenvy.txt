(late-fifteenth-century tapestry, flemish or french, in the burrell collection, glasgow art gallery and museum) 
have you time for a story 
(depicted in tapestry)? 
charity, riding an elephant, 
on a "mosaic of flowers," faces envy, 
the flowers "bunched together, not rooted." 
envy, on a dog, is worn down by obsession, 
his greed (since of things owned by others 
he can only take some). crouching uneasily 
in the flowered filigree, among wide weeds 
indented by scallops that swirl, 
little flattened-out sunflowers, 
thin arched coral stems, and—ribbed horizontally— 
slivers of green, envy, on his dog, 
looks up at the elephant, 
cowering away from her, his cheek scarcely scratched. 
he is saying, "o charity, pity me, deity! 
o pitiless destiny, 
what will become of me, 
maimed by charity—caritas—sword unsheathed 
over me yet? blood stains my cheek. i am hurt." 
in chest armor over chain mail, a steel shirt 
to the knee, he repeats, "i am hurt." 
the elephant, at no time borne down by self-pity, 
convinces the victim 
that destiny is not devising a plot. 
the problem is mastered—insupportably 
tiring when it was impending. 
deliverance accounts for what sounds like an axiom. 
the gordian knot need not be cut.
