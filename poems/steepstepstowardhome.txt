sun. sun laminated onto snow 
and sealed by wind. hardcover. 
before this, though, knee-deep 
slog through soft stuff. the heart 
jumps into the ears, a pulse 
in the eyelids begging no more, 
no more as the throat sores from 
so much laboured breath. 
back to sun. back to leaning 
into the steep of this hill. wind 
tries keeping you down, gravity 
tries keeping you down. aching 
knees and back and bones trying 
to keep you down. a body defied 
by its driver, by a mind's stubborn 
fix not to fail. wondering 
how much a heart can take before 
it bursts its walls, if there's any virtue 
in dying while doing what you love. 
agh, enough! enough of this 
self-punity, enough of this tough 
talk of rock and wind, so much 
effort just to hide in plain sight. 
then, i'm there. so close i could 
walk out onto air, brush the snow 
off guernsey island and sit. legs 
kicking out over the gulf, i blow 
a kiss to the magdalens, peer around 
anticosti to catch a glimpse 
of gulls in gaspé bay. lazy, 
in love with being alone up here, 
i yawn and stretch my arms wide 
as a smile, barely notice when 
i prick my finger on long point. 
seeing, then, that my windproof 
coat is the same colour as the ocean, 
as the sky, as all the things we never 
said when we should have and all this 
inexhaustible blue wears me down. 
now i'm gasping and the wind 
is dragging your name from my lips 
in heaves and sobs and i'm somehow 
in the driver's seat, engine running, 
heat on bust drying salt and snot against 
my skin. dumb with grief, finding myself 
mumbling we tried, we tried, into the hot, 
thick emptiness of a rental car.
