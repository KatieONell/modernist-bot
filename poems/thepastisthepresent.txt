revived bitterness 
is unnecessary unless 
one is ignorant. 
to-morrow will be 
yesterday unless you say the 
days of the week back- 
ward. last weeksâ€™ circus 
overflow frames an old grudge. thus: 
when you attempt to 
force the doors and come 
at the cause of the shouts, you thumb 
a brass nailed echo.
