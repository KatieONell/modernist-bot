as the hr macmillan space centre's sky 
theatre goes dim, my thoughts flip back 
like a page to honshu island, 
tourists ascending eroded, trash- 
laden paths under cover of darkness 
to glimpse milky morning light 
from fuji's summit. recently, 
i watched a video of the sun rising 
to calm myself. then clicked on 
a weird time-lapse gif depicting 
how a mother's internal organs 
move out of the way as her baby 
grows. when i tried to find it again 
to show you, i couldn't get 
the search term right. i can't forget 
how the sonographer paused, 
transducer in hand, to say "let's double- 
check that," her words a fault line 
in my heart cracking open. 
after the appointment, i took a taxi 
to meet you for the concert, 
frantically googling normal bi-parietal 
diameter en route, too petrified to read 
the results it generated. you said 
the musician was hosting a workshop, 
"laugh with laraaji," to help people 
get in touch with their inner child. i 
couldn't tell if you were 
confessing your desire to attend, 
mentioning it for my sake, or as 
a joke. sure, i've been under some 
stress lately. moving slow as a parade 
float drenched in tinsel. because 
my heart hurts. doubled blood volume 
roiling like lava through four red 
chambers. each day, up with the sunrise 
because my inner child is a metaphor 
and a literal tiny child who kicks 
me awake. myself and someone 
else, two me's. when he flipped 
into breach, i spent a week doing 
inversions on the carpet. you shone 
an incandescent flashlight 
at my belly, placed foam headphones 
around it. on the advice of 
the acupuncturist, burned moxa 
by my pinkie toes, hoping the heat 
would transmit a message to our son: 
go easy on me. everyone in the sky 
theatre is 23 and high and not 
pregnant. they smell like sweat 
and spearmint gum. i don't care 
anymore. laraaji is banging a gong 
and cackling into a microphone 
as galaxies slide on curved screens 
above his head. he wears robes 
the colour of the scorching sun. 
sometimes laughter swims 
through the body like a sound 
wave travelling back to the probe 
as an echo but there's no gif 
depicting this. cherry blossoms 
fall like floral meteors into a pond 
behind the planetarium at the same 
rate of speed as at the base of fuji. 
a mother eagle assembles a sturdy 
moss and feather loft for her newborns 
in the highest tree in vanier park 
because the view is nice. perhaps 
japanese bird mothers do the same, 
because who wouldn't want 
the very best for their children's 
eyeballs? who wouldn't want to 
listen to the calming sounds of 
laraaji's collaborator brian eno 
during 39 hours of labour 
followed by emergency c-section? 
you place an ipod beside 
the hospital bathtub and apollo 
drowns out my screams. i see stars. 
fly to japan. leave earth's atmosphere 
in a nitrous-fuelled rocket ship. 
beta blockers slow pyroclastic flows 
in my heart through the worst of it. 
even in this altered state, 
i'm only pretending i don't know 
what is happening to me. i know. 
as they lift the tiny person over 
the paper scaffolding and place him 
on my chest like a warm island, 
the sun rises over a mountain 
of ash and snow, carving living pathways 
through the maternity ward.
