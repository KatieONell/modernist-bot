sure fooled me. 
had me right up 
to the tinselly scraping 
when i downed 
the last mouthful 
and the ice cube turned 
out to be glass. 
arrowhead. 
shark's fin. 
lifting it out 
nearly cost me a finger 
never mind 
the carnage it 
could've caused 
in the throat. 
awe around the table 
as if i'd gone 
inadvertent skydiving 
or breezed through 
a tiger rodeo just while 
sipping, squeezing in 
a lime. see 
how the trick is turned. 
thrilling to be fooled so, 
like when i went to check 
the time in paris 
and a thief 's hummingbird 
caress left me gaping 
at my naked wrist. 
that was a touch 
i never felt, but this time 
i'm suffered to see 
how i'm spared. 
everyone wanted to touch it, tap, 
test their fingers on the edge. 
makes you want 
to try your luck again, 
the way a carnival bohunkus 
gawps at the stage; 
then jets his hand 
in the air with ballooning 
faith. me, me, 
pick me, mister. 
saw me in half. 
i believe.
