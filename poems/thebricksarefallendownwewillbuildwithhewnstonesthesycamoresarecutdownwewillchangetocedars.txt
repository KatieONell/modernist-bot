in what sense shall we be able to 
secure to ourselves peace and do as they did— 
who, when they were not able to rid 
themselves of war, cast out fear? 
they did not say: "we shall not be brought 
into subjection by the naughtiness of the sea; 
though we have ‘defeated ourselves with 
false balances’ and laid weapons in the scale, 
glory shall spring from in-glory; hail, 
flood, earthquake, and famine shall 
not intimidate us nor shake the 
foundations of our inalienable energy."
