they answer oneâ€™s questions: 
a deal table compact with the wall; 
in this dried bone of arrangement, 
oneâ€™s "natural promptness" is compressed, not crowded out; 
oneâ€™s style is not lost in such simplicity: 
the palace furniture, so old fashioned, so old fashionable; 
sã¨vres china and the fireplace dogsâ€” 
bronze dromios with pointed ears, as obsolete as pugs; 
one has oneâ€™s preference in the matter of bad furniture 
and this is not oneâ€™s choice: 
the vast indestructible necropolis 
of composite yawman-erbe separable units; 
the steel, the oak, the glass, the poor richard publications 
containing the public secrets of efficiency 
on "paper so thin that one thousand four hundred and twenty pages make one inch," 
exclaiming so to speak, when you take my time, you take something i had meant to use: 
the highway hid by fir trees in rhododendron twenty feet deep, 
the peacocks, hand-forged gates, old persian velvetâ€” 
roses outlined in pale black on an ivory groundâ€” 
the pierced iron shadows of the cedars, 
chinese carved glass, old waterford, 
lettered ladies; landscape gardening twisted into permanence: 
straight lines over such great distances as one finds in utah or in texas 
where people do not have to be told 
that "a good brake is as important as a good motor," 
where by means of extra sense cells in the skin, 
they can like trout, smell what is comingâ€” 
those cool sirs with the explicit sensory apparatus of common sense, 
who know the exact distance between two points as the crow flies; 
there is something attractive about a mind that moves in a straight lineâ€” 
the municipal bat-roost of mosquito warfare, concrete statuary, 
medicaments for "instant beauty" in the hands of all, 
and that live wire, the american string quartet: 
and bluebeardâ€™s tower above the coral reefs, 
the magic mousetrap closing on all points of the compass, 
capping like petrified surf, the furious azure of the bay 
where there is no dust and life is like a lemon-leaf, 
a green piece of tough translucent parchment, 
where the crimson, the copper, and the chinese vermilion of the poincianas 
set fire to the masonry and turquoise blues refute the clock; 
this dungeon with odd notions of hospitality, 
with its "chessmen carved out of moonstones," 
its mocking-birds, fringed lilies, and hibiscus, 
its black butterflies with blue half circles on their wings, 
tan goats with onyx ears, its lizards glittering and without thickness 
like splashes of fire and silver on the pierced turquoise of the lattices 
and the acacia-like lady shivering at the touch of a hand, 
lost in a small collision of the orchidsâ€” 
dyed quicksilver let fall 
to disappear like an obedient chameleon in fifty shades of mauve and amethyst: 
here where the mind of this establishment has come to the conclusion 
that it would be impossible to revolve about oneâ€™s self too much, 
sophistication has like "an escalator, cut the nerve of progress." 
in these noncommittal, personal-impersonal expressions of appearance, 
the eye knows what to skip; 
the physiognomy of conduct must not reveal the skeleton; 
"a setting must not have the air of being one" 
yet with x-raylike inquisitive intensity upon it, the surfaces go back; 
the interfering fringes of expression are but a stain on what stands out, 
there is neither up nor down to it; 
we see the exterior and the fundamental structureâ€” 
captains of armies, cooks, carpenters, 
cutlers, gamesters, surgeons and armorers, 
lapidaries, silkmen, glovers, fiddlers and ballad-singers, 
sextons of churches, dyers of black cloth, hostlers and chimney-sweeps, 
queens, countesses, ladies, emperors, travelers and mariners, 
dukes, princes and gentlemen 
in their respective placesâ€” 
camps, forges and battlefields, 
conventions, oratories and wardrobes, 
dens, deserts, railway stations, asylums and places where engines are made, 
shops, prisons, brickyards and altars of churchesâ€” 
in magnificent places clean and decent, 
castles, palaces, dining-halls, theatres and imperial audience-chambers.
