permission to use that snowball 
you've been keeping in the freezer 
since 1998. for a poem? she asks. 
what else? i say. i'll trade you, she says 
for that thing your mom said 
at the park. what was it? 
"god, that mallard's being a real douchebag"? 
yes, that one. deal, i say. okay, how about 
the korean boy who walks past 
our house late at night, singing 
"moon river"? oh, you can use that, i say, 
i wouldn't even know what 
to do with it. but there is something else. 
i've been wanting to write about 
the black skirt we've been using to cover 
the lovebird's cage. the goodnight skirt. 
in exchange, i'll let you have 
our drunken mailman, the tailless tabby, 
and i'll throw in the broken grandfather clock 
we found in the forest. one more, she says. 
last night, i say. the whole night. 
she considers for a while, then, 
okay, that's fair. but i really had something going 
with that lovebird. all right, i say, write it 
anyway. if it's more beautiful than mine, 
it's yours.
