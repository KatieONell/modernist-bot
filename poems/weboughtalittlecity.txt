first, we remove the dreadful yellow awnings from the shop-fronts in the square. 
brighten the streetlamps. play our instruments for the dairy cows crowding 
the fence. we angle for more daylight, fill out the appropriate paperwork. get 
down on hands and knees to clean out the ditches. we eat breaded fish for 
lunch, drink a cold beer, volunteer to play our part. no one complains of their 
dreams or dread. a mangy dog comes out of the forest covered in mud and 
stinking of deep time. belonging to the old owners, he wants nothing to do 
with us, knows we'll use him as a bridge: look, there he goes with a pheasant 
in his mouth. late october, the windows display ornamental gourds, tidy piles 
of leaves. evening in the forest, the eyes and mouths of jack-o-lanterns spark. 
a bark, a souvenir. way off the earth the moon muscles in, entirely invincible.
