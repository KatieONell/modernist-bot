this cloud is designed 
to move like a cursor from one side of the room to the other 
this cloud is designed to float inside 
uncorrupted by weather 
this cloud is easy to capture 
and won't last forever 
the cloud exists without a wonder 
of what anyone thinks     we study 
the cloud to learn this indifference     little deadpan filibuster 
the cloud makes a sudden diagonal 
move to the corner 
the crowd fills the space 
attempts to mimic its very nature 
as if one (just by watching) might gain 
a foothold 
knowing "the end" placard 
is mounted in the not-so- 
distant future
