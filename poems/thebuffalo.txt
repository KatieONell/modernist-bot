black in blazonry means 
prudence; and niger, unpropitious. might 
hematite- 
black incurved compact horns on a bison 
have significance? the 
soot brown tail-tuft on 
a kind of lion- 
tail; what would that express? 
and john steuart curryâ€™s ajax pulling 
grassâ€”no ring 
in his noseâ€”two birds standing on his back? 
though prints like this cannot 
show if they were black 
birds, nor the color 
of the back. the modern 
ox does not look like the augsburg oxâ€™s 
portrait. yes, 
the great extinct wild aurochs was a beast 
to paint, with stripe and sixfoot 
horn-spreadâ€”decreased 
to siamese-cat- 
brown swiss size, or zebu 
shape with white plush dewlap and warm-blooded 
hump; to red- 
skinned hereford or to piebald holstein. yet 
some would say the sparse-haired 
buffalo has met 
human notions bestâ€” 
unlike the elephant, 
both jewel and jeweler in the hairs 
that he wearsâ€” 
no white-nosed vermont ox yoked with its twin 
to haul the maple sap, 
up to their knees in 
snow; no freakishly 
over-drove ox drawn by 
rowlandson, but the indian buffalo, 
albino- 
footed, standing in the mud-lake, with a 
dayâ€™s work to do. no white 
christian heathen, waylaid 
by the buddha, 
serves him so well as the 
buffaloâ€”as mettlesome as if check- 
reinedâ€”free neck 
stretching out, and snake-tail in a half twist 
on the flank; nor will so 
cheerfully assist 
the sage sitting with 
feet at the same side, to 
dismount at the shrine; nor are there any 
ivory 
tusks like those two horns which when a tiger 
coughs, are lowered fiercely 
and convert the fur 
to harmless rubbish. 
the indian buffalo, 
led by bare-leggã¨d herd-boys to a hay 
hut where they 
stable it, need not fear comparison 
with bison, with the twins, 
nor with anyone 
of ox ancestry.
