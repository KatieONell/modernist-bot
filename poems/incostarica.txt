is found, of the amphibious falling dragon, the living firework. 
he leaps and meets his 
likeness in the stream and, king with king, 
helped by his three-part plume along the back, runs on two legs, 
tail dragging; faints upon the air; then with a spring 
dives to the stream-bed, hiding as the chieftain with gold body hid in 
guatavita lake. 
he runs, he flies, he swims, to get to 
his basilica—"the ruler of rivers, lakes, and seas, 
invisible or visible," with clouds to do 
as bid—and can be "long or short, and also coarse or fine at pleasure." with a 
modest quiver, he 
ascends the bank on clinging tree-frog 
hands, and waits; the water draining, forms a lizard there, from 
skin now looking a little newer than the log 
it rested on & the thick mass of verdure all about. this is the 
feather basilisk 
of travelers’ tales, of which a pair stood 
bodyguard beside confucius’ crib: aquatic flying 
lizard-fairy detested by such dragonhood 
as michael fought. one has seen animals like his, though smaller, collide 
and fight, brother matched 
with brother, as if immune to pain; 
push, struggle and breathe hard; swell out and muster strength, withdraw, 
advance; and swerving, almost fall—hoping to gain 
the mortal hold and that some fang should pierce the marrow. but when plumet 
territories touch, 
the masters of them are dramatic 
without shedding blood, exerting charm as chinese dragonwhiskers 
in a crystal handle charm; or as thickflowering 
orchids gather dragons, in the east, by forming clouds for them.
