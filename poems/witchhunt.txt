too many wannabe aleister crowleys 
con our teeth from us for pleasure, 
stir our cauldrons counterclockwise 
on the wrong stroke with their bent cocks. 
remember when they scorned us as faddish, 
trend-witches, all while whipping out 
their wands for instagram? remember 
when they blamed us for the limpness 
of their lyrics, beat our bodies, stole 
the markings they left, and passed these 
off as newfound runes? my warlock 
gaslights me for breakfast. poisons me, 
then vomits in my lap and plays at victim. 
my pain is really his is all my fault is just 
a curse he has to bear. he dolls me up, 
one hand shoved up my ass not quite 
without consent, to puppet at my mouth 
and make the world watch me say ‘papa' 
is a good ventriloquist. he calls this hoo- 
doo, like his white skin knew dark magic 
only as a sonic boon to juice for praise 
from other fools. he only asks forgiveness 
for his mental illness causing him 
to cause my mental illness, which is less real 
than his own. he says he needs my wisdom 
teeth for spellcraft, but the spell is one 
to cast my words against women like us. 
let's watch him claim this is a witch hunt, 
like the rest. let's be the bitch cunts 
he regrets, as though we women never 
once were burned when forced to stoke 
the flames for our own funerals. as though 
we witches cannot hunt where we were hunted.
