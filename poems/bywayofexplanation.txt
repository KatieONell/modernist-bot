you have this thing you can only explain 
by driving me out to the port at night 
to watch the towering cranes moving containers 
from ship to train. or we go skipping stones 
across the mirror of the lake, a ghost ship 
in a bottle of blue bombay gin by your side. 
i have this thing i can only explain to you 
by showing you a pile of computer hardware 
chucked into the ravine. we hike down there 
and blackberry vines grab our clothes as if to say, 
stop, wait, i want to tell you something too. 
you have an old photograph you keep in your 
bedside drawer. i have this song i learned 
on my guitar. by way of clarification, you send 
me a youtube video of a tornado filmed up close 
from a parked car. or a live-stream from a public 
camera whose view is obscured by red leaves. 
i cut you a key to this room, this door. 
there's this thing. a dictionary being consumed 
by fire. the two of us standing in front of a rothko 
until time starts again. a mixtape that is primarily 
about the clicks and hums between songs. what if 
we walk there instead of driving? what if we just drive 
without a destination? there's this thing i've always 
wanted to talk about with someone. now 
with you here, with you listening, with all 
the antennae raised, i no longer have to.
