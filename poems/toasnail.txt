if "compression is the first grace of style," 
you have it. contractility is a virtue 
as modesty is a virtue. 
it is not the acquisition of any one thing 
that is able to adorn, 
or the incidental quality that occurs 
as a concomitant of something well said, 
that we value in style, 
but the principle that is hid: 
in the absence of feet, "a method of conclusions"; 
"a knowledge of principles," 
in the curious phenomenon of your occipital horn.
