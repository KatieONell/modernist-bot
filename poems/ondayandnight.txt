and as the neighbors' guests retire, coaxing their cars 
into the snow (we're gazing through the curtain 
into winter's pale hub) two girls gaze up. they're all 
going home, like wheels correcting 
into steering hands, or drawn breath returning to the air, 
but you can't come back to anywhere—there's no perfect here 
and there, or now and then—but here we are, 
again. a silverfish crosses the windowpane. we peer 
into the street, and up at the stranded moon: white wheel, 
black field. black winter, white road. white silence, 
black wind. white cars, black wires.
