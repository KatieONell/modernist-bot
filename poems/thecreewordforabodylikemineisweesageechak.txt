of this kind of shape-shifting: sometimes i sweat and sweat until my 
bones puddle on the carpet in my living room and i am like the water 
that comes before new life. 
i was born during a falling leaves moon; which is to say that i have 
always been good at sacrifice. it is believed that women are most 
powerful during their moontime and because of this do not take part 
in ceremonies in order to let the body cleanse itself. there are 
weesageechak days when gender is a magic trick i forgot how to 
perform and my groin floods and floods trying to cleanse itself like 
the women and i too become toxic for men who have built cages out 
of broken boys. 
maybe if i surrendered myself to grandmother moon she would know 
what to do with these pickaxe wounds. there is so much i need to tell 
her about how my rivers and lakes are crowded and narrowing. how i 
managed to piece together a sweat lodge out of mud and fish and 
bacteria. she gives me the cree name weesageechak and translates it to 
"sadness is a carcass his tears leave behind." 
and the crows and flies who don't care about gender will one day 
make away with my jet-black finger nails and scraggly armpit hairs. 
they will lay tobacco at my grave and tell their crow and fly kin that i 
was once a broad-shouldered trickster who long ago fell from the 
moon wearing make-up and skinny jeans.
