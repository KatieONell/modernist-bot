b clicks fistfuls of amethysts. b is six. earlier this week, 
in an agassiz campground, she held a tiny 
abandoned rabbit. watership down, 
but with ravers, 
fire driving out the wildlife for the new wild life, edm 
and bike lights, b's mother gripping 
capsules stuffed 
with crystals 
in her fist. i tell my mother i never want kids. my mother teaches 
motherhood in ontario woods, leads la leche league, 
squirrels worn-out clothes 
for quilts to send 
overseas. my blood is hot, monthly, laced with misanthropy. 
these years as b's nanny, her nature scraping 
against my nurture. 
her mother 
couldn't breastfeed, couldn't risk trickling helixes of infected 
t cells, says she sometimes senses this 
distance. what bits of 
my mother 
insist in me? to what do i affix our distance? the burr thicket of it, 
sticky. the body's crystal arithmetic. b gives me 
an amethyst, tells me how 
the rabbit's heart 
beat beneath her fingertips.
