there was no precedent 
just a headache, despair, three 
cans of asahi plastic-bagged and 
there they were: 
most punched into the earth like 
square stud earrings, 
the rest pushed out, erect, 
fake flowers at their base the most 
colourful pubic hair. 
one grave said lagos, nigeria so i stood 
by it clasping the beer with the full stretch 
of my hand. 
i was the only live body around.
