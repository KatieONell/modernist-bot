ben johnson said he was? "o i could still 
like melting snow upon some craggy hill, 
drop, drop, drop, drop." 
i too until i saw that french brocade 
blaze green as though some lizard in the shade 
became exact— 
set off by replicas of violet— 
like sidney, leaning in his striped jacket 
against a lime— 
a work of art. and i too seemed to be 
an insouciant rester by a tree— 
no daffodil.
