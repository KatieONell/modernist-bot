they all had names like jennifer or lynne 
or katherine; they all had bone-blonde hair, 
that wet, flat cut with bangs. they pulled your chair 
from underneath you, shoved their small fists in 
your face. too soon, you knew it would begin, 
those minkish teeth like shrapnel in the air, 
the bacchic taunts, the herculean dare, 
their soccer cleats against your porcine shin, 
that laugh, which sounded like a hundred birds 
escaping from a gunshot through the reedsâ€” 
and now you have to face it all again: 
the joyful freckled faces lost for words 
in supermarkets, as those red hands squeeze 
your own. it's been so long! they say. amen.
