your soles found cement and you stopped 
horizontal just under the surface. 
nancy creek ends 
in a culvert you discovered 
three days after drowning. 
fuck you for ruining august 
when everyone 
and their step-parents drink pepsi 
kokanee on plastic chairs 
in backyards, the creek 
and cicadas drenching the air, toss bottles 
peanuts down into the water. 
you drowned in fawn lake five kilometres 
upstream and evaded 
everyone for three and a half stupid days. 
they closed the swimming area, men 
with dogs in the rushes. pylons 
lined the highway and tumbled 
in the rain. all that time 
you hid underwater, travelled 
feet-first with your face to the bottom, mud 
in your skin, turning circles 
in the silt 
thick current where the dogs 
couldn't find you. 
you left one nike 
behind the vaughns' house, caught 
in an eddy, kept worming 
downstream behind the fences 
of everyone you knew, through tree roots. 
your other shoe snagged 
on the underside of benji's dock 
with the yellow 
plastic waterslide 
we used to ride screaming.
