in america everybody must have a degree," the french man 
says, "but the french do not think that all can have it; they donâ€™t 
say everyone must go to college." we 
may feel as he says we do; five kinds of superiority 
might be unattainable by all, but one degree is not too much. 
in each school there is a pair of fruit-trees like that twin tree 
in every other school: tree-of-knowledgeâ€” 
tree-of-lifeâ€”each with a label like that of the other college: 
lux, or lux et veritas, christo et ecclesiae, sapiet 
felici, and if science confers immortality, 
these apple-trees should be for everyone. 
oriental arbor vitae we say lightly. yet you pardon 
it as when one thinking of the navy does not know not to infer 
dishonorable discharge from a d. d. it is a 
thoughtful pupil has two thoughts for the word 
valet; or for bachelor, child, damsel; though no one having heard 
them used as terms of chivalry would make the medieval use of 
them. secluded from domestic strife, jack bookworm led a 
college life says goldsmith. he might not say 
it of the student who shows interest in the strangerâ€™s resumã© 
by asking "when will your experiment be finished, doctor einstein?" 
and is pleased when doctor einstein smiles and says politely 
"science is never finished." but weâ€™re not 
hypocrites, weâ€™re rustics. the football huddle in the vacant lot 
is impersonating calculus and physics and military 
books; and is gathering the data for genetics. if 
scholarship would profit by it, sixteenfoot 
men should be grown; itâ€™s for the football men to say. we must lean 
on their experience. there is vitality in the world of sport. 
if it is not the tree of knowledge, itâ€™s the tree of life. 
when audubon adopted us he taught 
us how to dance. it was the great crab-flounder of montana caught 
and changed from that which creeps to that which is angelic. he taught us how 
to turn as the airport wind-sock turns without an error; 
like alligator, downpour, dynamite, 
and wotan, gliding round the course in a fast neat school, with the white 
of the eye showing; or as sea-lions keep going round and round the 
pool. but there is more to learnâ€”the difference between cow 
and zebu; lion, tiger; barred and brown 
owls; horned owls have one ear that opens up and one that opens down. 
the golden eagle is the one with feathered legs. the penguin wing is 
ancient, not degenerate. swordfish are different from 
gars, if one may speak of gars when the big 
gamehunters are using the fastidious singularâ€”say pig, 
and that they have seen camelsparrow, tigerhorse, rat, mouse, butterfly, 
snake, elephant, fruit-bat, et cetâ€™ra. no fact of scienceâ€” 
theology or biologyâ€”might 
not as well be known; one does not care to hold opinions that fright 
could dislocate. education augments our natural forces and 
prompts us to extend the machinery of advantage 
to those who are without it. one fitted 
to be a scholar must have the heroic mind, emerson said. 
the student concentrates and does not like to fight; "gives his opinion 
firmly and rests on it"â€”in the manner of the poet; 
is reclusive, and reserved; and has such 
ways, not because he has no feeling but because he has so much. 
boasting provokes jibes, and in this country weâ€™ve no cause to boast; we are 
as a nation perhaps, undergraduates not students. 
but anyone who studies will advance. 
are we to grow up or not? they are not all college boys in france.
