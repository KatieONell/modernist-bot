on the bus today, a man looked like you with your teeth 
removed, his lips a wild party on his face. father, you 
are not yet dead, though doctors keep removing bits 
of you. soon you'll carry me around, a few floaters in a jar, 
you shout through the phone. that shouldn't be funny, 
but is, the way it was funny you telling me to apologize 
to objects i bruised myself on as a child—don't tell me 
you hurt the cupboard door. it stopped me from crying. 
in this city where so many beggars look like you, i am 
stitching what i know about you into poems, sewing you 
together before you die, before i have to oblige you 
by just dumping your body into the ocean. how do i say 
you loved my mother through thirty years of sickness 
alongside your love of pork'n'beans and pilsner? to what 
do i affix your russian moustache? i know i will never fit 
in the fishing lessons i failed, the gray days i wandered 
away from you into the bushes. father, i never told you— 
i drank river water; i flipped over dead fish with a stick.
