walking among scepter-headed 
weeds and daisies swayed by wind, they said, 
"don’t scatter your 
stick, on account of the souls." led 
from sun-spotted 
paths, we went "where leafy trees meet 
overhead and noise of traffic is unknown"— 
the mind exhilarated 
by life all round, so stirringly 
alive. the root-handled cudgel 
with the bark left on, the woodbine smell- 
ing of the rain, 
the very stones, have life. little 
scars on church-bell 
tongues put there by the devil’s claws— 
authentic phantoms, ghosts, and witches, transformed 
into an invisible 
fabric of inconsistency 
motheaten by self-subtractives— 
now as outright murderers and thieves, 
thrive openly. 
an epigraph before it leaves 
the wax, receives 
to give, and giving must itself 
receive, "difficulty is ordained to check 
poltroons," and courage achieves 
despaired of ends. oppositely 
jointed against indecision, 
the three legs of the triskelion 
meeting in the 
middle between triangles, run 
in unison 
without assistance. yet, trudging 
on two legs that move contradictorily, 
irked by ghosts and witches, one 
does not fear to ask for beauty 
that is power devoid of fear. 
a bold outspoken gentleman, cheer- 
ful, plodding, to- 
the-point, used to the atmosphere 
of work—who here 
appropriate to the thought of 
permanence, says, "this is my taste, it might not 
be another man’s"—makes clear 
that stark sincere unflattery, 
sine cera, is both farthest 
from self-defensiveness and nearest; 
as when a seal 
without haste, slowly is impressed 
and forms a nest 
on which the raised device reversed, 
shows round. it must have been an able workman, 
studious and self-possessed, 
a liker of solidity, 
who gave a greenish waterford 
glass fool’s cap with summit curled down toward 
itself as the 
glass grew, the look of tempered swordsteel, 
and three-ore-d 
fishscale-burnished antimony- 
tin-and-lead’s smoky water-drop type-metal 
smoothness emery-armored 
against rust. its subdued glossy 
splendor leaps out at the eye as 
form dramatizes thought, in the glass 
witchball and air- 
twist cane. this paperweight, in mass 
a stone, surpass- 
ing it in tint, enlarges the 
fine chain-lines in the waterleaf weighted by 
its hardened raindrop surface. 
the paper-mould’s similarly 
once unsolid waspnest-blue, snow- 
white, or seashell-gray rags, seen through, show 
sheepcotes, turkey- 
mills, acorns, and anvils. "stones grow," 
then stop, and so 
do gardens. "plants grow and live; men 
grow and live and think." utilizey la poste 
aerienne, trade will follow 
the telephone. the post’s jerky 
cancellings ink the stamp, relet- 
tering stiltedly, as a puppet- 
acrobat walks 
about with high steps on his net, 
an alphabet 
of words and animals where the 
wire-embedded watermark’s more integral 
expressiveness had first set 
its alabaster effigy. 
in bark silverer than the swan, 
esparto grass, or so-called titan 
parchment tougher 
than hercules’ lion-skin—spanish, 
umbrian, 
eastern, open, and jeweled crowns, 
corroborate the dolphin, crane, and ox; sealed 
with wax by a pelican 
studying affectionately 
a nest’s three-in-one cartwheel tri- 
legged face. "for those we love, live and die" 
the motto says. 
and we do. part pelican, i, 
doubting the high- 
way’s wide giant trivia where 
three roads meet in artificial openness, 
am obliged to justify 
outspoken cordiality. 
firm-feathered juniper springing 
from difficult ground, the sky trembling 
with power, the rain 
falling upon the bird singing, 
modest printing, 
on honest paper properly 
trimmed, are gifts addressed to memory, and a 
gift is permanent, shining 
like the juniper’s trinity 
of spines. an unburdensomely 
worthy officer of charity, 
the evergreen 
with awlshaped leaves in whorls of three— 
successively 
firm. "on the first day of christmas 
my true love he sent unto me, part of a 
bough of a juniper-tree," 
javelin-ed consecutively.
