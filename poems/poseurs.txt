the walking stick insect was a late childhood horror, 
ugly as an umbrella's disrobing. 
moths, with brown wings the prize of 
asian fan-makers, pestered it like paparazzi. 
that peruvian variety, a race almost entirely female, 
would come down from the morello cherry long after sunset; 
after the plums turned the humid blue they want to be, 
after trees sighed and inhaled the nearby jasmine, blooming 
them nightly to dream-lives as smooth-complected date palms 
for some caliph's odalisque 
or the low-stress oregonian monkey puzzles, 
a species whose softly-prickled, rounded shoehorn limbs 
propose new kinds of orgasm. 
walking stick insects 
were squibs from the natural world, 
little stand-up comics 
fashioned after mutineered twigs. given half a chance, 
the poseurs would neither walk, nor meander, 
perambulate, or otherwise imitate 
wordsworth or nietzsche. like the wives of 17th century 
men of garden science, they loitered and lolled 
between vivarium and cabinet of curiosity, 
dividing their time between joy and sloth.
