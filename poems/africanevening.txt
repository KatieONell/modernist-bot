i had a thing for mange. 
her skin was fluorescent with it. 
the open canoe made smooth, curling sounds. 
it smelled like the man i am told is mother. 
mother sped his brain on pills. 
he limped. 
he gripped mother's leg and begged. 
the long open canoe had a wind inside 
and a yellow sky and a smell of mother. 
i went to the docks to pray. 
the trees were yellow, the trees were orange 
and her panties had been cut away. 
i had a thing for docks and praying on the little bronze pipes. 
i stained them with my fluid. 
i had a bald thing, a bashed in thing, a thing for her grease. 
in my arms i held an end of the long canoe and slit it 
sternum-first into the sea. 
a spectre is haunting europe 
but i feel the sun cocooning 
in a triple-breasted track suit 
when i think of you. thus we 
obtain our concept of the unconscious 
from the theory of repression, a sweet finish 
after the bitter pills of floggings and bullets, 
my tender-roni, my maytag blue – 
for real, you like them dresses? i'll bag the whole rack – let 
the ruling classes tremble
