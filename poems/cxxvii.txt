i'm staring at shakespeare's poem. blocked. carnage because black was not counted fairly. torn into faithless weather because literature assured black bodies bore no right to beauty's name, because until now is black's traumatology streaming in successive waves. the critics never unpack the intestinal douleur of one's own beauty slandered with a bastard shame. informed since i could read by the monarchy's hand on the throat of english, i've put on an enunciative face, trusting the figure of speech's power to fair the ink of english thinking. the foreign anguish, language! with art's facelessness i borrowed legit face; with my sweet syntax, a beauty that they couldn't disown. shame on who? shame on who? i'm literally bowed over the keyboard of my computer. sometimes you see yourself profaned. sometimes you're profaned—nothing unusual—by the archives you're working in. why feel disgraced in two thousand seventeen? le professeur francophone que j'ai rencontré on bumble blanks at my imaginary stresses: okay, your poems are about race, but we don't have to think in black and white over dinner, do we? somebody doesn't. this situation suits some bodies just fine, and they will date me, if i don't bring work home. i'm churning through shakespeare's sonnet, contemplating easier occupations. my children, who were not born into fairness, who no beauty ever lacked, who grievously never happened at all, read this grudging creation over my shoulder. they are with me always, as i fail at ease. they don't exist, as i cleave to my poetry like a significant other who never asks anything of me, who isn't hurt by my inability to lighten up. nothing's coming, just a gust of weather, a failure to work through a sonnet's hatred. slavery's tongue is in my head, kissing me, saying smile, smile, beauty shouldn't look so hard.
