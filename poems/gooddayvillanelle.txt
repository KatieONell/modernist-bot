you ran naked out the door. 
the neighbours laughed; i chased you down. 
i hardly see you anymore. 
i know you're busy. 
did i tell you when you were little how 
you ran naked out the door? 
you got halfway down the street 
before i caught you in my arms. 
i hardly see you anymore. 
i think i told you this before: 
i was giving you a bath and then 
you ran naked out the door. 
it happened fast. 
the neighbours laughed. 
i hardly see you anymore. 
you have to watch a baby close. 
i remember onceâ€” 
you ran naked out the door. 
i hardly see you anymore. 
i do not think that i could love a human being
