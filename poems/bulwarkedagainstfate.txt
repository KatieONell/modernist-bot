affirmed. pent by power that holds it fast— 
a paradox. pent. hard pressed, 
you take the blame and are inviolate. 
abased at last; 
not the tempest-tossed. 
compressed; firmed by the thrust of the blast 
till compact, like a bulwark against fate; 
lead-saluted, 
saluted by lead? 
as though flying old glory full mast.
