last night i dreamt of black seagulls 
and shapeshifting. 
man, woman, god, animal— 
and then grief, in the shape of a conversation 
between my father and a young waiter, 
strangers, both from dar es salaam, 
bonding over takeout orders and all of those buildings, 
so many new buildings, 
rising from the dregs of a backyard, a garden, 
a seven-shilling cinema, a mother's grave. 
after waking, i could taste swahili, 
while the floating pedals of my father's old bicycle 
whirred in my head 
like cogs, madly turning, fragmenting my life 
into questions: what am i? over and over again, 
what am i? 
earlier that day 
before the birds and the gashes, 
before the remnants of an old conversation, 
my father pulled up next to the fence, 
rolled down his car window and said, "i quit religion." 
my father, with the dark green qur'an 
that radiates in my memory, 
the man who ends every conversation 
with a prayer. 
here it is. a moment cut open, and a life 
reaching for heaven in the split seam, 
finding nothing, just air shapeshifting into air.
