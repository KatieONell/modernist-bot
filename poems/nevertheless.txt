you’ve seen a strawberry 
that’s had a struggle; yet 
was, where the fragments met, 
a hedgehog or a starfish 
for the multitude 
of seeds. what better food 
than apple-seeds—the fruit 
within the fruit—locked in 
like counter-curved twin 
hazel-nuts? frost that kills 
the little rubber-plant- 
leaves of kok-saghyz-stalks, can’t 
harm the roots; they still grow 
in frozen ground. once where 
there was a prickly-pear- 
leaf clinging to barbed wire, 
a root shot down to grow 
in earth two feet below; 
as carrots form mandrakes 
or a ram’s-horn root some- 
times. victory won’t come 
to me unless i go 
to it; a grape-tendril 
ties a knot in knots till 
knotted thirty times,—so 
the bound twig that’s under- 
gone and over-gone, can’t stir. 
the weak overcomes its 
menace, the strong over- 
comes itself. what is there 
like fortitude! what sap 
went through that little thread 
to make the cherry red!
