is an enchanted thing 
like the glaze on a 
katydid-wing 
subdivided by sun 
till the nettings are legion. 
like gieseking playing scarlatti; 
like the apteryx-awl 
as a beak, or the 
kiwi’s rain-shawl 
of haired feathers, the mind 
feeling its way as though blind, 
walks along with its eyes on the ground. 
it has memory’s ear 
that can hear without 
having to hear. 
like the gyroscope’s fall, 
truly unequivocal 
because trued by regnant certainty, 
it is a power of 
strong enchantment. it 
is like the dove- 
neck animated by 
sun; it is memory’s eye; 
it’s conscientious inconsistency. 
it tears off the veil; tears 
the temptation, the 
mist the heart wears, 
from its eyes,—if the heart 
has a face; it takes apart 
dejection. it’s fire in the dove-neck’s 
iridescence; in the 
inconsistencies 
of scarlatti. 
unconfusion submits 
its confusion to proof; it’s 
not a herod’s oath that cannot change.
