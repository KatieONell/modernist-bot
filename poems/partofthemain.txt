you might say that a clod washed away 
diminishes the whole, the contours 
of the land effaced by saintly 
patience of the tide, which knows 
that in time its tiny contributions 
add up to subtract from the shore, 
but this has all been said before, 
and better, long ago. carping on 
about it like the bloody-minded sea 
that drags its weight back and forth 
across the beach stones—madwoman 
at a washboard trying to scrub 
away the stain of what she's done— 
won't change the fact that it's easier 
to turn your back on everyone. 
show me bloated bellies on the television, 
dead children in their mothers' arms, 
bomb blasts making burnt-on 
crusts of people, and i will weep 
a rainy season, clench my fists 
until the nails leave lifeline sickles, 
but otherwise do nothing. 
i lack conviction. i am content 
to have my outraged moment, then sink 
into the comfort of an armchair 
that won't protest when i protest 
against the state of a continent 
worn down by indifference. 
despite this slow erosion 
of my sense of self 
as a moral being, i am happy 
paying for the services i'm given. 
my rooms are lit electrically; 
my rooms are heated. 
and in the middle of a heated moment, 
arguing with my wife over bills, 
over money to pay for all the luxury, 
i think: it's nice to have the luxury 
of fighting over debts. so i find myself 
indebted to people i have never met, 
those murdered by my radio 
while i drive the kids to school. 
i kill the volume so they won't know 
how much i owe the world, 
or turn the dial to crashing waves 
that wash away the dead.
