perceiving that in the masked ball 
attitude, there is a hollowness 
that beauty’s light momentum can’t redeem, 
since disproportionate satisfaction anywhere 
lacks a proportionate air, 
he let us know without offense 
by his hands’ denunciatory 
upheaval, that he despised the fashion 
of curing us with an ape—making it his care 
to smother us with fresh air.
