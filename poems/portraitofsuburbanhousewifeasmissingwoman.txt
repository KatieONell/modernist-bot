mouth open, she looked as though she was protesting 
her inclusion. i brought her to a place 
where no one speaks. there's been a mistake, 
she said with the soft folds 
of her tracksuit, the car keys 
she held like a set of brass knuckles. 
you can't take me anywhere i don't wish to go. 
i did have to drive out of town to take this picture. 
as evidence, it was the next day's news. 
now it's so obvious, her clavicle's hard line, 
the shadow there, a hollow big enough for two thumbs.
