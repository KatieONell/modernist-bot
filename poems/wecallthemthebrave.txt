who likely were reluctant to be brave. 
sitting by a slow fire on a waste 
of snow, i would last about an hour. 
better not euphemize the grave. 
in this fashionable town, endearments are the mode 
though generals are appraised—not praised— 
and one is not forced to walk about 
where a muddy slough serves as a road. 
"what are these shadows barely 
visible, which radar fails to scan?" 
ships "keeping distance on the gentle swell." 
and "what is a free world ready 
to do, for what it values most?" 
bestow little discs the bereaved may touch? 
can i ever forget it even when dead— 
that congressionally honored ghost 
mourned by a friend whose shoulder sags— 
weeping on the shoulder of another 
for another; with another sitting near, 
filling out casualty-tags. 
what of it? we call them the brave 
perhaps? yes; what if the time should come 
when no one will fight for anything 
and there’s nothing of worth to save.
