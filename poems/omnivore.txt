i eat what's put in front of me, 
as all great men do. should you eat shark? i know 
some wouldn't, but i do, if it's there. 
scorpions too, and their stingers; swallowing a scorpion 
won't poison you. old-time glue-makers 
made glue of old horses, and i 
make use when i can. 
someone put his wife in front of me; someone else, 
his mediocrity. what i know, i swear by— 
feed yourself, or die.
