older than the ancient greeks, than 
solomon, the pigeon family is a 
ramifying one, a 
banyan of banyans; to begin 
with, bluish slate, 
but with ability. modesty cannot dull 
the lustre of the pigeon 
swift and sure, coming quickest and 
straightest just after a storm. the great 
lame war hero cher ami, the 
lost battalionâ€™s gallant bird; and 
mocker with one eye 
destroyed, delivering his dispatch 
to his superiors; and sergeant dunn, 
civilian pigeon who flew eight 
hundred sixty-eight miles 
in four days and six hours; 
and destined to hatch 
in france, spike, veteran of 
the division in which mocker 
servedâ€”exceptional messenger. 
"rarely was confidence misplaced" a newspaper 
says. dastardly comment 
inexactly phrased, as used of her- 
mes, ariel, or leanderâ€” 
pigeons of the past. neither was confidence 
misplaced in the javan- 
sumatran birds the dutch had had 
brought from baghdad. 
mysterious animal with a magnetic 
feel by which he traces backward 
his transportation outward, 
even in a fog at sea, though glad 
to be tossed near enough the loft 
or coop to get back the same day. 
"home on time without 
his message." what matter since he has 
got back. migrating always in the same 
direction, bringing all letters 
to the same address, see- 
ing better homes than his, 
he is not theudas 
boasting himself to be some- 
body, this anonymous post- 
man who, as soon as he could fly, 
was carrying valentines and messages of 
state; or soberer newsâ€” 
"so please write me and believe that i 
am yours very truly"; fine words 
those. an instrument not just an instinctive 
individual, this 
dove, that lifts his right foot over 
the alighting- 
board to rejoin his ungainly pin-clad dark-skinned 
brood as domestic turtle- 
doves might; two. invariably 
two. the turtle, a not exciting 
birdâ€”in britain shy, detected 
by its constantly heard coo, with- 
out a song but not 
without a voiceâ€”does well to stay far 
out of sight; but the pelew pigeon with 
black head, metallic wasp-lustred 
grass-green breast and purple 
legs and feet, need not; nor 
need the nicobar, 
novel, narrow-feathered dove. 
and one should see the papuan 
fancrests with six-sided scale which 
coats the foot; "not much is known about these splendid 
birds" hid in unimag- 
inably weak lead-colored ostrich- 
plumes a third of an inch long, and 
needle-fine cat-whisker-fibered battleship- 
gray lace. the samoan 
tooth-billed pigeon fortunately 
survives alsoâ€” 
saved from destruction by no longer feeding on 
the ground, a bird with short legs 
and heavy bill, remarkable 
because related to the dodo. 
didus ineptus; manâ€™s remorse 
enshrines it now, abundant still 
in sixteen-one. "a 
little bigger than our swans, these birds 
want wings and lay but one egg" the traveler 
saidâ€”"defenceless unsuspicious 
things, with a cry like the 
cry of a gosling." il 
dã³udo (the words 
mean simple one)â€”extinct as 
the solitaires which having "raised 
their young one do not disunite." 
a new pigeon cannot compensate, but we have 
it. with neat-cered eye, long 
face, trim form and posture, this delight- 
ful bird outdoes the dashingly 
black and white dalmatian dog and map-freckled 
pony that indians dress 
with feathers seriatim down 
the mane and tail;â€” 
a slender cinderella deliberately 
pied, so she on each side is 
the same, an all-feather piebald, 
cuckoo-marked on a titanic scale 
taking perhaps sixteen birds to 
show the whole design, as in chess 
played with men and hors- 
es. yes, the thus medievally 
two-colored sea-pie-patterned semi-swan- 
necked magpie-pigeon, gamecock-legged 
with long-clawed toes, and all 
extremesâ€”head neck back tail 
and feetâ€”coal black, the 
rest snow white, has a surpris- 
ing modernness and fanciness 
and stateliness andâ€¦. yes indeed; 
developed by and humbly dedicated to 
the gentlemen of the 
feather club, this is a dainty breed.
