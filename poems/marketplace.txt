and another thing the realtor says islisten, kids, i've been around the block for a cool decade. think i'm bullshitting you? i practically invented selfie- with-misspelled-name-on-starbucks-cup and our eyes flit to the desk where a marble paperweight in the shape of an inukshuk throws shade across his nameplate 
you and i, we've always been suckers for stacked rocks and authority figures with sun-damaged hair, so we shrink back and whisperwe don't know where we belongdropping hands below the city's sight to make fishhooks of our pinkies 
he laughsyou think someone gave me a trout? i had to learn toand makes a casting motion, silver watch leaping at his wrist and we know this is where home is, shy of the surface, hooked always and thrashing beneath.
