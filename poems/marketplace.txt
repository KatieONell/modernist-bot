and another thing the realtor says‚Ä®is‚listen, kids, i've been around the block‚Ä®for a cool decade. think i'm bullshitting‚‚Ä®you? i practically invented selfie-‚Ä®with-misspelled-name-on-starbucks-cup‚Ä®and our eyes flit to the desk where a marble‚‚Ä®paperweight in the shape of an inukshuk‚‚Ä®throws shade across his nameplate‚Ä® 
you and i, we've always been suckers‚‚Ä®for stacked rocks and authority figures‚‚Ä®with sun-damaged hair, so we shrink back‚‚Ä®and whisper‚we don't know where‚‚Ä®we belong‚dropping hands below the city's‚‚Ä®sight to make fishhooks of our pinkies‚‚Ä® 
he laughs‚you think someone gave me‚‚Ä®a trout? i had to learn to‚and makes a casting motion,‚Ä®silver watch leaping at his wrist and we know‚Ä®this is where home is, shy of the surface, hooked‚Ä®always and thrashing beneath.
