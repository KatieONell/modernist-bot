said hi to you in school, it didn't strike you 
that he might know you from the internet. you didn't 
remember who he was, not even when he called you 
by your fake name. all you thought was, "i can't 
do this again. i want to be clean. i want to be shazia." 
if you end this poem here, it might make sense, 
but we both know this kind of work is occult. 
so, you have to ask me: how do you want to finish 
this poem? you have to leave it there. that way 
at least it's not about you anymore.
