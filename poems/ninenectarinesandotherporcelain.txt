arranged by two’s as peaches are, 
at intervals that all may live— 
eight and a single one, on twigs that 
grew the year before—they look like 
a derivative; 
although not uncommonly 
the opposite is seen— 
nine peaches on a nectarine. 
fuzzless through slender crescent leaves 
of green or blue—or both, 
in the chinese style—the four 
pairs’ half-moon leaf-mosaic turns 
out to the sun the sprinkled blush 
of puce-american-beauty pink 
applied to beeswax gray by the 
unenquiring brush 
of mercantile bookbinding. 
like the peach yu, the red- 
cheeked peach which cannot aid the dead, 
but eaten in time prevents death, 
the italian peachnut, 
persian plum, ispahan 
secluded wall-grown nectarine, 
as wild spontaneous fruit was 
found in china first. but was it wild? 
prudent de candolle would not say. 
we cannot find flaws 
in this emblematic group 
of nine, with leaf window 
unquilted by curculio— 
which someone once depicted on 
this much-mended plate; or 
in the also accurate 
unantlered moose, or iceland horse, 
or ass, asleep against the old 
thick, low-leaning nectarine that is the 
color of the shrub-tree’s brownish 
flower. from manifold 
small boughs, productive as the 
magic willow that grew 
above the mother’s grave and threw 
on cinderella what she wished, 
a bat is winging. it 
is a moonlight scene, bringing 
the animal so near, its eyes 
are separate from the face—mere 
delicately drawn gray discs, out from 
itself in space. imperial 
happiness lives here 
on the peaches of long life 
that make it permanent. 
a fungus could have meant 
long life; a crane, a stork, a dove. 
china, with flowers and birds 
and half-beasts, became the land 
of the best china-making first. 
hunts and domestic scenes occur 
in france on dinner-plates, signed on the 
back with a two-finned fish; england 
has an officer 
in jack-boots seated in a 
bosquet, the cow, the flock 
of sheep, the pheasant, the peacock 
sweeping near with lifted claw; the 
skilled peonian rose 
and the rosebud that began 
with william billingsley (once poor, 
like a monkey on a dolphin, tossed 
by ocean, mighty monster) until 
josiah spode adopted him. 
yet with the gold-glossed 
serpent handles, are there green 
cocks with "brown beaks and cheeks 
and dark blue combs" and mammal freaks 
that, like the chinese certainties 
and sets of precious things, 
dare to be conspicuous? 
theirs is a race that "understands 
the spirit of the wilderness" 
and the nectarine-loving kylin 
of pony appearance—the long- 
tailed or the tailless 
small cinnamon-brown common 
camel-haired unicorn 
with antelope feet and no horn, 
here enamelled on porcelain. 
it was a chinese who 
imagined this masterpiece.
