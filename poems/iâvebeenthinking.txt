make a fuss 
and be tedious. 
i’m annoyed? 
yes; am—avoid 
"adore" 
and "bore"; 
am, i 
say, by 
the word 
bore, bored; 
refuse 
to use 
"divine" 
to mean 
something 
pleasing; 
"terrific color" 
for some horror. 
though flat, 
myself, i’d say that 
"atlas" 
(pressed glass) 
looks best 
embossed. 
i refuse 
to use 
"enchant," 
"dement"; 
even "fright- 
ful plight" 
(however justified) 
or "frivol- 
ous fool" 
(however suitable). 
i’ve escaped? 
am still trapped 
by these 
word diseases. 
no pauses— 
the phrases 
lack lyric 
force; sound capric- 
like attic 
capric-alcaic, 
or freak 
calico-greek. 
(not verse 
of course) 
i’m sure of this: 
nothing mundane is divine; 
nothing divine is mundane.
