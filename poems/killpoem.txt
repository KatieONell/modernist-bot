i found a mouse 
caught in the trap. 
i killed the mouse 
with quick little taps. 
its shrieks were squeaks 
to my human ears. 
tap tap tap 
with my boot heel. 
the mouse man came 
with all his poisons. 
little pink pellets 
is what was chosen. 
now no mice 
move through the walls. 
now no mice 
bother to call. 
little pink pellets, 
little pink pills. 
it's all very human, 
i don't have to kill. 
no mice in the walls 
means i can work. 
tap tap, a poem. 
tap tap, this verse.
