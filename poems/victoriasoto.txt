in the poem i show to no one, a young teacher hides 
her students from a gunman, lifts 
them into cupboards—her hands smoothing 
their hair, closing cupboard doors. thousands of miles 
away, snow falls into a small northern town 
where i write, twenty children fell as snow. the light 
turned less familiar as it reflected 
off their bodies. i've never been to connecticut, 
but i imagine a town hall filled with photo albums, 
yellow roses, teddy bears, family members circling small 
tables, retelling the story of twenty 
short lives—they woke, ate cereal, and a stranger walked 
into their school with his hands full 
of guns. i stay awake all night, clicking through holes 
in the internet, finding her photo, victoria, thumb-sized 
with dark hair, light eyes, clear skin. she stared 
directly into the camera and then, how much later, hid 
children in cupboards and turned 
to the shooter to collect a violence the television 
calls "random". it turns over in me, repeats as snow 
repeats—on the radio, television, in the thin voices 
of my neighbours—when twenty children fell, 
the world felt less familiar—and falling again with each 
retelling, the snow and the stranger, 
the teacher who smoothed their hair.
