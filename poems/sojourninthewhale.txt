trying to open locked doors with a sword, threading 
the points of needles, planting shade trees upside down; swallowed by the opaqueness of one whom the seas 
love better than they love you, ireland— 
you have lived and lived on every kind of shortage. 
you have been compelled by hags to spin gold thread from straw and have heard men 
say: "there is a feminine 
temperament in direct contrast to 
ours which makes her do these things. circumscribed by a 
heritage of blindness and native incompetence, she will become wise and will be forced to give 
in. compelled by experience, she 
will turn back; water seeks its own level": and you 
have smiled. "water in motion is far 
from level." you have seen it when obstacles happened to bar 
the path—rise automatically.
