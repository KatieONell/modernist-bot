literature is a phase of life: if 
one is afraid of it, the situation is irremediable; if 
one approaches it familiarly, 
what one says of it is worthless. words are constructive 
when they are true; the opaque allusion—the simulated flight 
upward—accomplishes nothing. why cloud the fact 
that shaw is self-conscious in the field of sentiment but is otherwise re- 
warding? that james is all that has been 
said of him, if feeling is profound? it is not hardy 
the distinguished novelist and hardy the poet, but one man 
"interpreting life through the medium of the 
emotions." if he must give an opinion, it is permissible that the 
critic should know what he likes. gordon 
craig with his "this is i" and "this is mine," with his three 
wise men, his "sad french greens" and his chinese cherries—gordon craig, so 
inclinational and unashamed—has carried 
the precept of being a good critic, to the last extreme; and burke is a 
psychologist—of acute, raccoon- 
like curiosity. summa diligentia; 
to the humbug, whose name is so amusing—very young and ve- 
ry rushed, caesar crossed the alps on the "top of a 
diligence." we are not daft about the meaning but this familiarity 
with wrong meanings puzzles one. humming- 
bug, the candles are not wired for electricity. 
small dog, going over the lawn, nipping the linen and saying 
that you have a badger—remember xenophon; 
only the most rudimentary sort of behavior necessary 
to put us on the scent; "a right good 
salvo of barks," a few "strong wrinkles" puckering the 
skin between the ears, are all we ask.
