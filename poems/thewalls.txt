we cannot act until we have all the facts. 
we will never have all the facts. we act. 
we expand the wall. we found others. 
they are living breathing streets, walls 
are. this fact arouses us to erect wall 
after wall. we think only of the walls. 
we think of the walls as stitches 
in a blown apart body. the stitches 
bring this body back together. the walls, 
embracing the globe, will do the same 
for us. if not, we will work until every 
body is walled off from every other 
body. think of the thrill we'll feel 
when we tear down those walls, excited 
by the sudden wall of bodies or the joy 
of building all those walls anew.
