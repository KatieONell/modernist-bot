on a rainy morning in the worst year 
of my life, as icy eyelets shelled the street, 
i shared a tremor with a doberman 
leashed to a post. we two were all the world 
until a bicyclist shot by, riding 
like a backward birth, feetfirst, 
in level, gentle ease, with the season's hard breath 
between his teeth. the rain was almost ice, the sky 
mild and pale. i saw a milk carton bobbing by 
on a stream of melting sleet. 
a bicyclist. a bicyclist. he rode away— 
to his home, i guess. i went home, 
where i undressed, left my jacket 
where it fell, went straight to bed, and slept 
for two days straight. but those clicking wheels 
kept clicking in my head, and though 
i can't say why, i felt not only not myself, 
but that i'd never been… that i 
was that man i hardly saw, hurling myself 
into the blast, and that everything 
i passed—dog, rain, cold, the other guy— 
i left in my wake, like afterbirth.
