no tricks, 
i just love them 
as my own blood 
and keep my eyes 
on the ceiling. 
o brothers, i sing, 
your bodies are thick 
as wrists, your skins 
my only book. 
i relieve them 
of poison, 
i undo what they do. 
i'm charcoal and paper. 
touch me: i leave 
a mark on your hand. 
this is just costume, 
my depression dress, 
my buckled shoe. 
tin flowers in my ears 
play spiral-groove blues.
