your eyes open the night's slow static at a loss 
to explain this place you've returned to from above; 
cedar along a broken shore, twisting in a wake of fog. 
i've lived in rooms with others, of no place and no mind 
trying to bind a self inside the contagion of words while 
your eyes open the night's slow static. at a loss 
to understand all that i cannot say, as if you came 
upon the infinite simply by thinking and it was 
a shore of broken cedar twisting in a wake of fog. 
if i moan from an animal throat it is in hope you 
will return to me what i lost learning to speak. 
your eyes open the night's slow static at a loss 
to ever know the true terminus of doubt, the limits of skin. 
as long as you hold me i am doubled from without and within: 
a wake of fog unbroken, a shore of twisted cedar. 
i will press myself into potential, into your breath, 
and maybe what was lost will return in sleep once i see 
your eyes open into the night's slow static, at a loss. 
broken on a shore of cedar. we twist in a wake of fog.
