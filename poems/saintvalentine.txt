permitted to assist you, let me see … 
if those remembered by you 
are to think of you and not me, 
it seems to me that the memento 
or compliment you bestow 
should have a name beginning with "v," 
such as vera, el greco’s only 
daughter (though it has never been 
proved that he had one), her starchy 
veil, inside chiffon; the stone in her 
ring, like her eyes; one hand on 
her snow-leopard wrap, the fur widely 
dotted with black. it could be a vignette— 
a replica, framed oval— 
bordered by a vine or vinelet. 
or give a mere flower, said to mean the 
love of truth or truth of 
love—in other words, a violet. 
verse—unabashedly bold—is appropriate; 
and always it should be as neat 
as the most careful writer’s "8." 
any valentine that is written 
is as the vendange to the vine. 
might verse not best confuse itself with fate?
