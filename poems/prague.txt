someone had left a mannequin in the street. 
it was wearing a wedding dress 
andâ€”but no, 
it was a woman, standing on a box. 
a small crowd had gathered around her 
and her eyes were closed. 
i hesitated. then 
reached down to the jar at her feet 
as if i were bending to pet a stranger's dog. 
and as though i had deposited a soul, chink, 
her eyelids fluttered open, 
her fingers flickered, 
she awoke like hermione 
astonishing her husband 
in the miraculous final scene of the winter's tale. 
later, through the window of a restaurant, 
i saw her dash across a crowded street, 
clutching her skirts to keep them from the rain.
