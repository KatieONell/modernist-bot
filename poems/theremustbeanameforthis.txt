how to feel like how you imagined the city? a blur of light steps out of a cab. 
stem of a glass in a ring on a wet table. slink, slink. would it have been better 
if you had moved into that little beehive level with the skytrain, whoosh all 
day, glow all night, little hexagram. one stool, one door, two windows at an 
angle with the tracks, tracks, track. two windows! rattle rattle goodnight all 
day. you imagined glass and water, heels and click, the film of alcohol across 
everything, city city. little dots of light, little swipes. a secret: vancouver 
is actually a series of small caves, mould like a dust of sugar powder, did 
you know? saturday night aesthetic: the chevron station for yachts in coal 
harbour, hovered out in the water, glossy black, little ring, orange light. how 
long did it take me to realize the white-hot squares at the top of downtown are 
penthouses? how long did it take me to realize those very regular fireworks 
are private planes? why can't i have, why can't i have, why can't i? what if 
we just kept living together, what if i just tried harder, what if i had moved 
to toronto? all the women in this city say i love you, they say centered, we 
say seawall, we go home and murmur toronto toronto seattle toronto in our 
sleep. you don't understand. i have an obligation to a girl in a barn, to a girl 
in a car, to a girl in the forest; she says get me out of here, she says my own 
apartment. is it possible to be dissociated not from me but the city. like here 
i am arms and legs, here i am oh new york.
