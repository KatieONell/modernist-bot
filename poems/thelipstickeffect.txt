you know you need a new one when you're bored 
or overcome or underwhelmed, or sad, 
when you can feel the jangles of your age; 
when you have matters weighing on your mind 
(the news, your kids, the heft of your behind)â€” 
or change arrives, the flipping of a page: 
you lose a job, move house, cremate your dad, 
then add another colour to the hoard 
amassed in your boudoir. their names alone 
inspire revolution at some level, 
assuring you there's fire down below 
(your husband says it's snuffed), a latent vamp, 
a dolce vita waiting where you camp 
and, on the prairie, cherries in the snow. 
beneath the paint, you're neither sleek nor evil. 
it's just the tubes, the hollow names, you own.
