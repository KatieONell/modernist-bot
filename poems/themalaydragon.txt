we have ours; and they 
have theirs. ours has a skin feather crest; 
theirs has wings out from the waist which is snuff-brown or sallow. 
ours falls from trees on water; theirs is the smallest 
dragon that knows how to dive head-first from a tree-top to something dry. 
floating on spread ribs, 
the boat-like body settles on the 
clamshell-tinted spray sprung from the nutmeg-tree—minute legs 
trailing half akimbo—the true divinity 
of malay. among unfragrant orchids, on the unnutritious nut 
tree, myristica 
fragrans, the harmless god spreads ribs that 
do not raise a hood. this is the serpent-dove peculiar 
to the east; that lives as the butterfly or bat 
can, in a brood, conferring wings on what it grasps, as the air-plant does.
