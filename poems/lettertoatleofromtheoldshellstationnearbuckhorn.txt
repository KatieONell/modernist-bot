dear shawn: you should have seen it, the way that yellow and orange clam shell glowed like the flame atop a machinery stack, the way it burned into that pre-winter night. we were on our way up to those old spearfishing traps on big bald lake in the offseason when we came upon it. couldn't help but to think of you and how you kept yourself warm with harper and all his suncor buddies along the grand shores of kitchissippi. we all know the sort of muck that oil and sand can make out of you, and we all know that heat breaks down viscosity, so we thought of you and stopped a little while at the station. or at least, that's the sort of learning that assimilation brings our actions to nowadays. but you remember that truth is in the handwriting of the cheque writer. we all know that bureaucrats write up those beautiful six-foot-by-two-foot photo ops. they are the closest thing any modern-day indian has to being on currency. the boys and i saw you, a big grey wolf wide smile, and knew that we had to pay with a cheque. debit cards and credit are for places with industry and names that remind of us of how empty our lives were before hydroelectric projects and government transparency acts. you know us, always looking to prove ourselves better than average treaty indians, we took a couple of photos of us handing over the fifteen dollar rbc cheque to old man macintosh beneath that setting sun of a shell sign. sure, everything is astronomically more expensive off reserve, but who needs family, friends, or culture when a little bit of currency and big city fame can float between you and those making those james bay sized cheques. best, 
j.w.
