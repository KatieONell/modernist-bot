i learned the secret of serenity 
by waterboarding daffodils. 
my buddha is landfill. 
my mantra choked 
from a bluebird's neck. 
it's ruthless, the pursuit 
of happiness. eighteen 
seconds have elapsed. 
my happiness is twice 
your size, gold-chained 
to the lamppost. it strains 
its waistcoat as it grows. 
flog a sunbeam, harness 
a cloud. you should be feeling 
five times happier now: 
the world is your kleenex. 
it's been a long sixty-three 
seconds in attawapiskat, 
but my happiness digs 
diamond mines, slobbers 
parasol knobs on the rhine. 
i sweeten my cantaloupe 
with stolen breastmilk. 
peak joy is at nine 
times nineâ€”saddle up, dear. 
an asteroid of happiness 
is blasting through 
the atmosphere.
