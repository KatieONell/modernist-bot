"attack is more piquant than concord," but when 
you tell me frankly that you would like to feel 
my flesh beneath your feet, 
i’m all abroad; i can but put my weapon up, and 
bow you out. 
gesticulation—it is half the language. 
let unsheathed gesticulation be the steel 
your courtesy must meet, 
since in your hearing words are mute, which to my senses 
are a shout.
