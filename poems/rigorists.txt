"we saw reindeer 
browsing," a friend who’d been in lapland, said: 
"finding their own food; they are adapted 
to scant reino 
or pasture, yet they can run eleven 
miles in fifty minutes; the feet spread when 
the snow is soft, 
and act as snow-shoes. they are rigorists 
however handsomely cutwork artists 
of lapland and 
siberia elaborate the trace 
or saddle-girth with saw-tooth leather lace. 
one looked at us 
with its firm face part brown, part white,—a queen 
of alpine flowers. santa claus’ reindeer, seen 
at last, had gray- 
brown fur, with a neck like edelweiss or 
lion’s foot,—leontopodium more 
exactly." and 
this candelabrum-headed ornament 
for a place where ornaments are scarce, sent 
to alaska, 
was a gift preventing the extinction 
of the esquimo. the battle was won 
by a quiet man, 
sheldon jackson, evangel to that race 
whose reprieve he read in the reindeer’s face.
