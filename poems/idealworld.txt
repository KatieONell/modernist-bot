nothing matters in an ideal world. 
not the stones you skip, 
not the fat birds overhead. 
run your fingers through the sand all day. 
lie still as a ship at the bottom of the sea. 
stick out your tongue 
and taste the wrecked century 
in a melting snowcone purchased for a peso. 
all you taste is the taste of it. 
light plucks the coins from your eyes, 
the heart spends its store 
on a few everlastings 
jutting from cracks in the boardwalk. 
call it a kingdom nevertheless. 
watch the light black canopy 
lower from the west 
where a rust-stained tanker spins 
a slow pirouette en route to oblivion 
via sudan. 
if you feel lonely 
it's because you were borne this way. 
if there are clouds here 
they must be ideal clouds. 
clouds you can see through.
