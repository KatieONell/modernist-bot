the can command a room. the bevel-fisted 
mayor of sackville, the renison dean, sire 
of four children. the wake up at six and read 
the paper until his ears turned red and shook. 
the recorder of the demise of his canada, 
the staunch, the solid, deliverer of grace at 
dinner, the turkey carving, owlish eye-browed 
thick-knuckled brooder, diabetic candy-stasher, 
home-video spanish-breast ogler, after dinner 
own chest-napper, model railway builder, 
false hip bearer. the devouree of cancer from 
anus to eyeball. the caved-chest weeper, 
holder of hands, composer of own elegy, 
which i read, in part, shaking at the pulpit.
