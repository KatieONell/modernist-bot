this is the sound i was trying to make: 
in the film in the film, they're shooting a big-budget prequel to jaws, 
but the rubber shark heads are being eaten by a real-life shark. 
the sound of the rubber pieces being chewed— 
not easy, but i'd done harder and worse. 
which makes me think. i knew a boy named kevin 
when i was too young to know the difference 
between rubber and real, though rubber is real, 
and kevin knew a place to hide in the valley so good 
that no one ever found him though he kept appearing 
startling people in their sliding doors. he was locked in the glass 
as if he'd done something so sinister his punishment 
needed flair to amuse the ones who'd been wronged. 
once, though, someone snapped a photo 
and swore it was kevin there, watching—we all knew 
it was bunk, the person knew too, but then we started 
talking about it: do you remember that time 
i stuck a pin in his waterbed for no reason really 
or the time he got dressed up as his mother but not in her clothes? 
we retrieved the old albums, unpacked the taped boxes, 
found the one botched life-sized drawing 
he'd done of himself and completed it 
together as a neighbourhood, a district, a city, 
practically a nation at this point, and then a sort of galaxy 
expanding outward at a speed so great that when kevin 
walked out of the picture with a boom 
it almost wasn't a surprise, so fast were we moving… 
but kevin was back, and he shook our hands, 
revealed the crevice he'd made in the dirt 
and told everyone sorry for pulling this stunt. 
and then he lived his long life. he married, 
had children, difficult years, divorced, rebuilt— 
and double back to the start again on this slight tilt: 
in the film in the film they don't need to add any sounds 
to the mix because the shark that swims in and chews up 
all our likenesses is already perfectly captured.
