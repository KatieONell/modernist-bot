if yellow betokens infidelity, 
i am an infidel. 
i could not bear a yellow rose ill will 
because books said that yellow boded ill, 
white promised well; 
however, your particular possession— 
the sense of privacy 
in what you did—deflects from your estate 
offending eyes, and will not tolerate 
effrontery.
