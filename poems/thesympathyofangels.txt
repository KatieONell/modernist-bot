being of tragic bent 
we incline to the future 
and the past. but we 
see you. we 
see how tired you are 
as you lean on your rifle 
or your shovel. 
we see the fired shells 
and the head they go into. 
we too are shells, 
you too are graves. 
equally to all men, we 
have nothing to say. 
adore. we are just. we 
serve a monarch 
in a silk sarcophagus.
