growing up, i 
did not have books 
the only reading material 
there was 
were old newspapers laid out 
on the floor 
to dry 
our winter boots 
or wrap 
things of glass 
when i learned to read, 
the winter boots 
lay dripping 
in the hallway; 
the glass, broken 
and uncovered 
because i knew this 
this 
would be my way in
