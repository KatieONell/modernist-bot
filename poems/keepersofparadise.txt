this is a hand that intends to do its maker harm. 
this is the clock turned back five hundred years. 
the river that runs from eden mouth 
to rare unsweetened mouth. 
i've logged the sour dawns of all 
my quiet into this body, 
its crisis of fleeing nowhere when nowhere is home. 
and reborn half-bled in our nighttime 
diverging their sullen brethren, their patterns of vapour, 
rain, shadows on goat-eaten planes 
in the morse events of smallest things 
in my new metropolis away. 
i am a simple child, then, a tilled site of history. 
call me isobar. distraction in place of earth. 
call me tropical depression 
where i regale to the world its problem of beaten pines, 
pleading rivers returning thorns to their abducted bush. 
i'd offer the wound night shuts behind my eyesâ€” 
but enough. hear morne d'or divinize her song. 
give these coon keepers of paradise a liminal eavesdrop. 
hear ghostly algorithms translate these nights to bloom.
