you wild, uncooked young fellow! 
the swinkã¨d hind will stumble home 
not looking at the tasks he scorned to shirk. 
impelled to respite by rough hands, 
the labored ox will bellow; 
while you stand there agape before your handiwork. 
not all good men are mellow. 
you savor of a walnut rind, 
of oak leaves, or plucked mullein on the brae. 
and yet with all your clumsiness, 
you give me pleasure, fellow; 
your candor compensates me for my old bouquet.
