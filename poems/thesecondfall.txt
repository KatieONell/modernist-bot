happens at the theatre. we embrace and i am panicked-calm, 
a mouse wrapped in a snake, my small sparrow heart rattling 
its cage as i seek out your farm boy smell: grease oil dirt 
lentils spoiled. i look for a husk forgotten, caught in a lock 
of your hair. i want to ask about the woman behind you 
because she is beautiful and staring with eyes like lake louise. 
but my tongue is stiff, a bleached carp, plump carcass 
on pebbled sand. i bend down to pick it up, trip 
into the water. and you are french braiding my hair the way 
your sisters taught you. and you are carving out the feathery bones 
of jackfish on your counter. and you are whipping 
brown sugar and flour into a soft syrup, offering me the spoon. 
and you are driving your boat through a ditch the summer 
all of saskatchewan flooded and everyone thanked god 
for crop insurance. and you are reading out loud to me, 
your tongue stumbling. (you say sorry and i say i don't mind 
but i do a little.) and you are showing me a photograph 
of your mother who died of cancer in the same hospital 
you were born in, bones poking through papery sheets, 
her stomach a hollow bowl you could drink from. 
and you are undressing me in the middle of your cold kitchen. 
and you are undressing me trembling as a rabbit caught wild 
in the long grass of the graveyard near town. 
(we are hidden by windows grey with frost, 
pale lacy ferns pressed onto the glass.) 
and you are kissing goosebumps across my collar bone. 
and you are dragging me, dead-heavy and drenched, 
from the lake you showed me how to fish in, back to shore.
