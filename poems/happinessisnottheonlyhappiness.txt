my hair has grown well past my shoulders, 
a feat i achieved by not cutting it. 
also this year i have learned something new 
about daylight. it keeps us awake. 
likewise the moonlight, the searchlight, 
the low blue glow on the dashboard 
that carries each through her own private dark. 
rue is a sun-loving plant. 
tornadoes want us to chase them. 
when summer finally arrives it arrives 
in a rainstorm. wind enters the spruce 
and comes out wearing sparrows. 
some say water tastes best 
from a bucket, some say a cupped palm.
