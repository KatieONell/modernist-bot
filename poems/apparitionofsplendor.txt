partaking of the miraculous 
since never known literally, 
dürer’s rhinoceros 
might have startled us equally 
if black-and-white-spined elaborately. 
like another porcupine, or fern, 
the mouth in an arching egret 
was too black to discern 
till exposed as a silhouette; 
but the double-embattled thistle of jet— 
disadvantageous supposedly— 
has never shot a quill. was it 
some joyous fantasy, 
plain eider-eared exhibit 
of spines rooted in the sooty moss, 
or "train supported by porcupines— 
a fairy’s eleven yards long"? … 
as when the lightning shines 
on thistlefine spears, among 
prongs in lanes above lanes of a shorter prong, 
"with the forest for nurse," also dark 
at the base—where needle-debris 
springs and shows no footmark; 
the setting for a symmetry 
you must not touch unless you are a fairy. 
maine should be pleased that its animal 
is not a waverer, and rather 
than fight, lets the primed quill fall. 
shallow oppressor, intruder, 
insister, you have found a resister.
