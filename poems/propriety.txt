bach’s solfegietto— 
harmonica and basso. 
the fish-spine 
on firs, on 
somber trees 
by the sea’s 
walls of wave-worn rock—have it; and 
a moonbow and bach’s cheerful firmness 
in a minor key. 
it’s an owl-and-a-pussy- 
both-content 
agreement. 
come, come. it’s 
mixed with wits; 
it’s not a graceful sadness. it’s 
resistance with bent head, like foxtail 
millet’s. brahms and bach, 
no; bach and brahms. to thank bach 
for his song 
first, is wrong. 
pardon me; 
both are the 
unintentional pansy-face 
uncursed by self-inspection; blackened 
because born that way.
