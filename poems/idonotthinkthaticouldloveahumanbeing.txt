know it if i squeezed too hard. i would be a great bear. i would 
go rumbling through. 
i would try to eat you. i would stand alone, 
in the quiet centre of you, and roar. no, i 
could not love you. i could not 
love a human being. 
i would get so 
stuck on things. the small 
flaws in you, like 
the way that you will die; 
it would stick in my throat, i could not love you. 
and the way that, if you touched me, i would be 
as if to you a solid object, 
as if a boot, a stick, a stone. 
and you to me. the way that i could 
pick you up. that i could 
hammer you against me; that i could 
bruise myself on you, and still have only a 
brief impression of you left there on my skin. 
and, if i cried, that too would be 
an imitation of the thing that i would feel. 
and the pain itself, if it were real, would come as if 
so separately from you that it might 
equally have been a whip, a rope, 
a rail with which i thrashed myself when i 
thrashed myself with you. 
no, i could not love a human being if they 
could not leave a mark. 
even if i were a bear 
and i ate you, you would 
move right through me. 
even if you were a bear 
and you ate me, i would 
move right through you. 
but i am not a bear. and will not eat you. 
if i said i could, i could not. 
and you are not a bear. and will not eat me. 
and that is why i could not love you. 
and that is why i could not love you. 
and that is why i could not love you.
